    "title": "Digital culture industry: a history of digital distribution",
    "abstract": "members are the key precondition of participatory network communication that is so successful in making new attractions and meanwhile recirculating older media shows (pp. 49, 90). Reviewing the residual culture with academic insight, it further deals with the relationship between contemporary media operation and residual economy (pp. 95–105). Presenting case studies on the American television industry, the strongest part of the book, Chapters 3 and 4 continue to explore a tension between audience engagement, piracy, and media industries’ reward for this engagement. In the process, the authors resist any easy definition of ‘meaningful participation’. Rather than persuading whether corporations or consumers should be granted greater power to take responsibility for our qualified lives, they argue that it is the deeply intertwined powers from both that shape the media ecology (p. 156). The next two chapters focus on content producers’ creative strategies for their ‘alternative’ audience, taking examples from both marketing initiatives and nonprofit media makers. While audiences are ‘alternative’ in their frequently changing preferences for the commercial mainstream, the creators are also ‘alternative’ enough to increase spreadability through correspondingly amplifying content characteristics and exploiting audiences’ motivations. Interestingly, a couple of techniques are introduced with detail to make media contents go viral (pp. 202–218). In order to achieve some balance on global insight, the topic of transnational media flows is discussed in the last chapter where a variety of typical mimetic practices in a worldwide context like hip-hop culture in Japan or fansubbing in China are discussed. However, as the problem of cultural hegemony is given no consideration, it is hard to be convinced that spreadability could promote diverse intercultural media communication. While Spreadable Media inevitably repeats some of Jenkins’ discussions about fandom participation, the authors manage to locate the effect of media convergence, the interdependence of entertainment agents and active audience, the contradictions between attention economy and piracy and the democratic bottom-up power in the context of digital culture from an original perspective. Not all of the analyses in the book are easy to digest, though media and communication scholars, professionals, and people who are interested in popular digital issues would benefit from its theoretical and empirical approach.",

    "abstract": "In face-to-face contexts, the use of emotional nonverbal cues tends to increase support satisfaction. However, it is not known whether emotional nonverbal cues function in the same manner in supportive interactions conducted across e-mail. This article reports the findings of two empirical studies examining the association between nonverbal cues, support satisfaction, and communicator sex. Results indicate that female senders use more emotional nonverbal cues than do male senders, yet nonverbal cue usage is not associated with the recipient's support satisfaction. This suggests that emotional nonverbal cues expressed online may lose potency relative to such cues in offline contexts.",

    "title": "Editorial comment",
    "abstract": "Mobility has almost become a mantra in the discourse of the Information Age. Yet like many similar emergent properties used to grasp profound sociotechnical changes it is frequently alluded to in discussions without any clear understanding about what it means. Our first article in this issue of Information, Communication & Society (iCS) by Catelijne Coopmans directly addresses the questions of what it means for data to be mobile and what it takes for data to become mobile. These are important questions at a time when many commentators take it as axiomatic that the mobility of data will continue to increase as a consequence of information and communications technologies (ICTs). Instead of asking what is meant by data mobility, however, this form of reasoning is limited to discussions of the positive and negative effects and consequences of mobility as a fixed asset of digital data. Coopmans’s approach in her article is to provide an alternative sociology of data mobility that is sensitive to social contexts which shape and inform both data and mobility as they are articulated in practice. This is achieved through exploring the merits and limitations of Latour’s concept of the ‘immutable mobile’ when applied to a particular analysis of mobile data in the form of medical images such as mammograms. Such a focused investigation leads the author to reveal the flaws in Latour’s model and propose a more nuanced understanding of the ways in which the relationship between data, digital technologies and mobility are articulated in practice. Coopmans concludes her piece by suggesting how this perspective could have important implications for understanding e-Science and telemedicine and for the sociological analysis of data and mobility. In our second article in this issue of iCS Nicholas Gane invites us to consider more closely the relationship between the perceived accelerated processes of social and cultural transformations and the appropriate role of social theory as a means of understanding this phenomenon. In particular, the author questions whether social theory should attempt to keep pace with this rapid social change and how this could be achieved. Or whether, conversely, social theory should operate on a different platform that is detached and critical of the logic of capitalist acceleration, which raises different methodological problems. Gane addresses these alternative perspectives through the work of Scott Lash and Peter Lunenfeld, who argue that social theory should speed up, and Marshall McLuhan, Paul Virilio and Jean",

This paper locates Taylor's work in the broad historical development of formal systems and ‘rational’ management. The paper notes the historical continuities that link the ‘technologies of control’ which emerged in US industry during Taylor's lifetime and those which appear in contemporary work organizations. This is counterpoised with recent comment on the information technology and the ‘end’ of Taylorist work practices.",

    "abstract": "Dyer-Witheford’s Cyber-proletariat: global labour in the digital vortex (2015) is a richly detailed and colourful book. It expertly navigates a vast array of contemporary and historical cases to construct the argument that with the growth of cybernetics, that is networks, computers, and digital technologies, the notion of social class ‘has become ontologically not less, but more real, more extended’ (p. 8). Drawing on autonomous Marxism, Dyer-Witheford advocates for a fresh analysis of how cybernetics perpetuates the differences between the capitalist super-rich and the unor under-employed. The book makes this argument by describing realworld examples, such as the 2011 occupy movement and Apple Foxconn factories in China, with such intricate detail that in addition to its academic rigour, the book transcends into an engaging, whilst occasionally harrowing, fiction-like narrative. The effect being that it is often difficult for the reader to resist being drawn in, difficult not to empathise, and difficult not to feel for the global proletariat. Cyber-proletariat (2015) is an excellently written book, in which no words are wasted to make a powerfully convincing and thought-provoking argument for the tension within the cyber-proletariat relationship. The reader is challenged to ask:",

    "title": "Risk issue adoption in an online social movement field",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article extends the field conceptualisation of social change and innovation adoption, which hinges upon the strategic capacities of actors, to the online environment. We focus on a key aspect of social movement organisations (SMOs), competition for members, resources and attention over an environmental risk issue. The incorporation of network theory enables us to map how the structural position of actors in the field is associated with their actions – for example, their response to an exogenous shock such as a new threat to the environment. We analyse how actors in the online environmental movement respond to the emergence of nanoscience and technology (NST) as a risk issue, and test the field theory hypothesis that dominated actors are more likely to adopt this issue in the early stages of emergence. Our findings challenge field theory orthodoxy and suggest that whilst challengers innovate, dominants co-opt by adopting the issue in a second stage. Finally, we examine why the notion that NST entails significant environmental and health risks was not propelled into wider public consciousness.",

    "title": "Understanding attitudes towards social media segregation: spatial metaphors in the discussion of Twitter blocklists",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Blocking other users is a common act on Twitter but one which is underexplored from a scholarly perspective, particularly the analysis of mass blocklists. Although traditionally associated with harassment, blocklists are increasingly engaged to create individualised environments that align with users’ personal convictions and exclude apparent transgressors. This study uses a pro-choice blocklist (Repeal Shield) created during the 2018 Irish abortion referendum campaign to explore how users interpret these altered boundaries and blocklists’ influence on the Twitter landscape. A metaphor analysis of more than 2,000 tweets discussing the blocklist highlights the dominant concepts in how users visualise Twitter as both a personal space and a battlefield, in which mental health is a key factor. By drawing on discussions of spatiality, agency, gender and online interactions, we can see how these blocking affordances allow users to exist in spaces in which they construct their own parameters to feel safer, raising questions about how harm, health and risk are understood. The article explores how users make sense of conflicting images like ‘safe spaces’ or ‘echo chambers’, highlighting the apparent policing role held by blocklists. Users are negotiating the type of civic space in which they want to exist as norms of engagement versus avoidance collide; although digital spaces have always accommodated fragmented interests, the technological affordances of blocklists provide more rigid boundaries, highlighting how the evolving architecture of social media allows users to redefine the parameters of their own online spaces.",

    "title": "THE VIRTUAL UNIVERSITY AS 'TIMELY AND ACCURATE INFORMATION'",
    "abstract": "This article investigates the implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning System in a redbrick university in the UK. The first part is concerned with the way in which the implementation project team has come to conceptualize its task or mission and represent it both to itself and to the rest of the university. On one hand, the discussion is about the rolling-out of a rather mundane information system, purchased simply as a replacement for an out of date system called 'MAC'. On the other, for some people, the system amounts to a large, and complex - almost mythical - model of the university, a kind of 'virtual university'. Specifically,the article is interested in one particular phrase, script, or mantra that appears over and over as the accepted rationale, mission and justification for the project: the 'provision of timely and accurate information'. It is argued that the phrase helps to mediate the boundary between how the project team and others understand the university as a whole, and the ways in which it is, could be, and should be changing. The second part of the article is focused on the way in which those implementing the new system are attempting to move the university from an old (seemingly 'chaotic') model to a new (supposedly 'ordered') 'informational model'.",

    "title": "Professional journalists in ‘citizen’ journalism",
    "abstract": "Scholars, journalists, and laypeople alike have argued that the relatively new field of citizen journalism (CJ) offers a space where citizens can act as amateur reporters to challenge the dominance of mainstream media. However, contrary to popular expectations, a large number of CJ sites include current or former professional journalists as contributors, calling into question the new field's independence from the mainstream media. Using a content analysis of a sample (n = 326) drawn from the largest sampling frame of English-language CJ websites based in the United States to date (n = 1958), we explore potential explanations for the presence of professional journalists as contributors on CJ sites. In a series of logistic regression analyses, we find evidence that for-profit CJ sites and those with editorial staffs are more likely to have professional journalists. Furthermore, we find that sites with professional journalists do not offer significantly different content when controlling for other factors. Based on these findings, we theorize that CJ websites seek out professional journalists as a means of gaining legitimacy within a new organizational field. These results indicate a growing professionalization within the field of CJ and the persistence of a public sphere dominated by elite actors.",

    "abstract": "Neuroanesthesia is a rapidly changing field. Understanding of neuroscience is fundamental to the practice of neuroanesthesia. Functional MRI (fMRI) has improved our knowledge of CNS and anesthetic action on the CNS to a great extent. Among the various fMRI parameters like regional cerebral blood flow, BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent contrast a qualitative measure of neuronal activity) and connectivity, functional connectivity images the functional integration between related regions of the brain. Dr Bonhomme’s article (pp. 474–479) describes our current understanding of the effect of anesthesia on connectivity. MRI is a powerful imaging tool and is now available in many neuro-operating rooms. This has improved our imaging capability in the neurosurgical cases. But MRI in the operating room has also introduced several problems/ issues apart from avoiding ferromagnetic elements in the room. Dr Soriano’s article (pp. 480–486) covers the various intricacies, which have to be understood in a MRI operating room. Neuromonitoring technology –",

    "abstract": "It has almost become axiomatic in community informatics (CI) research around the world that the manner and extent of adoption of new media technologies is significantly influenced by the social and cultural context of their design, development and diffusion. Factors influencing the extent of participation by community members, the levels of commitment of all stakeholders over prolonged periods of time, the degree of epistemological conflict or the perceived relevance of ICTs to diverse everyday lifestyles can all act to provide powerful barriers to the implementation of collaborative CI initiatives. These challenges are refreshingly explored in our opening article by Wendy Mee, Evie Katz, Leila Alem and Simon Kravis, who document their experiences as members of a multidisciplinary team established to build a web-based knowledge portal to support water quality management in an Australian wet tropical region. The project assumed that the adoption of a community participation approach would be more likely to lead to support for a knowledge-sharing tool designed to enhance sustainable development. In the event the authors identify and examine three important sociotechnical challenges in the early stages and a prematurely terminated project. These three factors raise valuable questions about demands placed on participatory approaches to community informatics. First, the authors highlight the problem of identifying the motivating factors ensuring widespread interest and participation in the project by community members. Second, the challenges in creating an intelligible means of communication and understanding within competing professional discourses and between ‘experts’ and lay community knowledge are cogently argued. Finally, the article foregrounds the paradox of a meta-design that requires commitment from people at a time when the technology is still undefined and emergent. This case study raises pertinent lessons for those researchers embarking upon community-centred informatics initiatives Our next articles share the common theme of the potential role of ICTs for facilitating the greater political and civic engagement of young people. Many countries in the world are reporting the disaffection with democratic governance of their young citizens. In Italy this increasingly familiar picture of young people distrusting their politicians withdrawing from participation in electoral politics is outlined by Davide Calenda and Lorenzo Mosca. In this case, however, the authors suggest that this trend is paradoxically",

    "title": "THE USE OF THE INTERNET AMONG ACADEMIC GAY COMMUNITIESIN TAIWAN : AN EXPLORATORY STUDY",
    "abstract": "The rise of the internet has tremendous impacts on homosexual communities in Taiwan. The internet has created a medium where homosexual people can form virtual communities to seek for emotional support without fearing the disclosure of their sexual preferences and causing unwanted negative consequences. The internet has become a medium where homosexual communities can share information with each other and voice their concerns to the public. Thus, the internet may become what Ithiel de Sola Pool (1984) called 'the technology of freedom' for homosexual communities. The purposes of this paper are set to discuss whether academic homosexual individuals perceive the internet to be more fair and impartial in terms of news reporting than traditional mass media and to investigate why they use the internet. This paper employs a questionnaire survey method to collect data for the questions. The quantitative analysis of survey data (N=701), from a self-completed questionnaire using modified snowball sampling of gays and lesbians from Taiwan. Principal component analysis with varimax rotation led to seven factors that account for 66.31% of the variance. These factors are social interaction and information, entertainment and relaxation, personal revelation, preference, privacy and escapism, pass time and, novelty-seeking. Correlation analyses also suggested that respondents' demographics, internet usage frequency and, time are associated with their use motivation. As an exploratory study of an academic homosexual population and their internet use behaviour in Taiwan, this study raised more questions than it intended to answer. The use of individual media by this group needs further study.",

    "abstract": "This article relates the textual processes of looking and gazing on MOO's (multiuser object oriented worlds) to feminist theories of the gaze. The gaze and look are privileged terms in these chat oriented settings because of the programming decision to associate information inquiries with the typed command to 'look '. The use of the look command makes it seem that physiognomy oriented character descriptions and architecturally familiar room types can be seen. Many users want to believe that character descriptions offer a view that is like the 'real' body of the user. The constructed nature of the character, literally produced by text, is partially concealed by the insistence that the metaphorical sight of the look is the equivalent of truth. A series of other commands, such as @watch, @peruse, @kgb, @fbi, @scope, glance, @peep, @gawk, and see, also emphasize sight so that the textual setting is made over into a visual space. The names of these commands, and the detailed sets of i...",

    "abstract": "At the close of the 20th century, all eyes were focused on the future. In The Gordian Knot: Political Gridlock on the Information Highway, policy analysts W. Russell Neuman, now of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, Lee McKnight and Richard Jay Solomon, both of the Center for Technology, Policy, and Industrial Development at MIT, remind us that we need to be watchful of the potholes created by past regulatory models in order to steer clear of them as we forge new policy for a national information infrastructure for the 21st century. In fact, they suggest a total break from the past. The authors’ thesis – that the emerging telecommunication technologies require a complete shift in the existing policy paradigm so as not to sti e their development and usage – is captured in their ‘Gordian Knot’ metaphor. For those unfamiliar with the story, King Gordius of ancient Phrygia tied a rather impressive tangle of rope and challenged all visitors to untie the knot, promising to abdicate his throne to anyone who succeeded. Many tried, but only Alexander the Great understood that the solution required a completely radical approach – in one fell swoop he severed the knot with his sword. Unless policy makers similarly come to understand that the new communication technologies require a completely radical approach to policy formation, they will be doomed to political gridlock forever, the authors argue. The book takes us through an historical analysis of communications policy, showing how none of the old regulatory models – the public trustee model of broadcasting, the common carrier model of the telephone, or the current deregulatory marketplace model – make sense for emerging digital electronic networks. The central argument is that the forebearers of today’s digital networks (namely the telegraph, telephone, broadcasting and, before that, railroads and highways) are so fundamentally different that retrotting the old legislative models will result in stunted economic and technological growth of the ‘information highway.’ The fundamental differences to which the authors refer include the fact that the new networks are decentralized, non-hierarchical, and fast-changing. Such differences have left policy makers groping for appropriate regulatory schemas for the burgeoning communications media. In addition, technological convergence afforded by digitization complicates the regulatory picture even further.",

    "title": "INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND THE CHARACTER OF CONTEMPORARY LIFE",
    "abstract": "The paper deals with the basic features of the life-space created by contemporary information industry,and with the dominant attitudes towards the opportunities and limitations information technology offers and imposes. We consider the problem of information glut, the quality of public discourse, the question of privacy and technological alienation. Concerning the basic attitudes, we discuss the aesthetic, the moral and the religious views, considered in the context of the present life-space pervaded and shaped by information technology. The paper concludes with a discussion of the possible consequences of global homogenization and of the cultural ahistoricity that are being created by the massive use of information technology. Among the positive aspects of this new 'global culture of the present' we point out the possible increase of global human solidarity; among the negative ones, we point out the flattening and shrinking of the space of human experience, which this uniform culture of the present imposes.",

    "abstract": "What’s so great about feeling normal? Why is it that many LGBT+ people invest so much emotional and political energy buying into the very systems that were constructed to exclude them? What role do various media forms – particularly those made by and for queer audiences – play in the interpellation of queer people into the national body politic? These are the questions addressed by F. Hollis Griffin’s Feeling Normal: Sexuality and Media Criticism in the Digital Age. Through an examination of an array of queer media forms – films, television, dating apps, and queer newspapers – Griffin shows how these texts work by an appeal to queer desires for belonging to a nation-state that has, all too often, excelled at excluding them. Affect provides the linchpin for his analysis, the means by which he avoids positioning queer audiences as unwitting (or at least passive) recipients of capitalist and neoliberal ideology while also maintaining a rigorous focus on the politics associated with such media. As he explains,",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\n Extreme weather events like the heat wave of 2018 reinforce public attention for climate change. Social media platforms facilitate, define and amplify debate about this topic. They give rise to counterpublic spaces through which counterpublics such as climate sceptics get a stage they would not easily get in mainstream media. Previous research suggests that sceptics use these spaces as safe havens, but also as bases for interventions in the hegemonic debate. Applying a multideterminant frame model, we analyse the Twitter debate among climate change ‘sceptics’ and ‘believers’. We study all tweets in which the heat wave was related to climate change and which were shared by Dutch and Flemish users between 28 July 2018 and 4 August 2018. Laying bare the worldviews underlying the frames of sceptics and non-sceptics, we first demonstrate the diversity of – unilaterally interacting – ideological interests. Building upon this analysis of the scope of the debate and analysing its form, we show that both groups mostly use similar antagonistic strategies to delegitimize and denaturalize their out-groups. We argue that these interventions promote polarization rather than a constructive agonistic debate. As such, this study refutes previous studies that consider sceptic frames as deconstructive and non-sceptic frames as constructive.",

    "abstract": "The book under review is a collection of awareness, justifications and thoughts of the use of technology in everyday life by Kim Vicente. At first glance, this book may turn away our attention from the potential intrinsic worth of information and communication technologies (ICTs). However, the book is much more than that. By challenging our philosophical belief of ICTs, we understand how all our lives are being engineered. Throughout this book, Kim Vicente suggests that our understanding of ICTs or any technologies we have established, centre on a ‘human–technology gap’, i.e. the lack of consideration of how societal and organizational factors influence the introduction of ICTs which could then result in a disaster. For instance, September 11 terrorists planned their attack to achieve their own political agenda by using an existing complex technology that was exactly tailored tomeet their destructive purpose. The social gap between the political human factors and the technology in the service of their own political aims led to incredible human suffering and destruction. At the organizational level, the US Immigration system was not enough to prevent the terrorists from easy entry to the country using student visas, because an appropriate technology for the organization has not been established despite that fact that several of the terrorists were already known enemies of the United States. Through these kinds of formative examples, he makes a convincing argument as to how technologies are so harmful when human beings use them in an inappropriate way. This book places his flow of thoughts in a row; hence in this review I shall identify the major themes of this book, rather than give a chapter-by-chapter account of the book. Whilst this book refers to many worst-case technological",

    "abstract": "The potential role of information and communications technologies (ICTs) in facilitating international economic development has been of interest to scholars and policy-makers for some considerable time. A number of research publications, based largely on single-country case studies and/or particular technologies, have alluded to the benefits for improved health services, environmental impact studies, agricultural research, distance education and micro-credit loan services, which can accrue from the adoption of ICTs in poorer countries. Whilst the significant disparities in the diffusion of new media between economically developed countries and the rest of the world are frequently acknowledged there has been an increasing optimism among some commentators that some developing countries with the right telecommunications policies may be able to leap-frog over others and develop into ‘information societies’. This could be achieved, for example, by developing countries avoiding the expensive investments made by more economically developed countries into wired infrastructure and instead building cheaper infrastructures of wireless communication technologies. To date, however, the leap-frog hypothesis has not been sufficiently tested by scholars to demonstrate how applicable the metaphor is to the growth of information societies. Our opening article by Philip Howard in this issue of iCS examines the leap-frog theory by exploring the impact of existing telecommunications infrastructure on changes in access to ICTs for over 200 countries between 1995 and 2005. His analysis suggests that during this time frame successful leap-frog countries emerging as information societies are rare. Indeed, the relative distribution of ICTs across the selected countries has remained fairly static. Those countries that Howard identities as successful leap-frog examples are already amongst the wealthiest of the world. Of particular importance perhaps, is the author’s contention that policy reform in the telecommunications sector, such as privatization, regulatory separation and depoliticization, or market liberalization, has been less important for the few successes than economic prosperity. Our second article in this issue of iCS written by Victor Thiessen and Dianne Looker examines the differential effects of ICTs on the reading achievement of young people. The authors draw on the theoretical supposition of Bourdieu and his later adherents that those with higher levels of capital in one sphere (i.e. cultural capital) are more likely to be able to convert it into other forms of capital (i.e. economic and/or social capital).",

    "title": "Understanding the value of networked publics in radio: employing digital methods and social network analysis to understand the Twitter publics of two Italian national radio stations",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Radio audiences are today a mix of traditional radio broadcasting audiences and networked publics (boyd, d. [2007]. Why youth (heart) social network sites: The role of networked publics in teenage social life. In D. Buckingha (Ed.), MacArthur foundation series on digital learning–youth, identity, and digital media volume (pp. 119–142). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Ito, M. [2008]. Introduction. In K.

Papacharissi (Ed.), A networked self identity, community, and culture on social network sites (pp. 39–58). London: Routledge). This not only means that new media is changing the nature of listeners/viewers, transforming them into interactive users, but also that radio publics, once organized into networks, may have different properties, different behaviours and different values. In this paper, we have employed Digital Methods (DM) (Rogers, R. [2009]. The end of the virtual. Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press) and social network analysis to understand the Twitter activity and the communicative dynamics of the audiences of two Italian national radio stations: Radio3 Rai (public service station) and Radio Deejay (private commercial station). This work also aims to respond to a question asked by Rogers when defining DM: ‘Could the information contained in profiles on social networking sites provide different insights into the composition and characteristics of publics?’ (Rogers, R. [2009]. The end of the virtual. Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press). Based on the results that have emerged from this study, we believe that the answer can be affirmative: the analysis of the social connections and the interaction models of the networked listeners highlights new features of these audiences, and allows us to reevaluate and understand them from new points of view. This work shows that the digital audiences related to the two radio stations clearly distinguish themselves for their distinctive online behaviour and a different display of social networks, cultural capital and affect. We therefore hypothesize the presence of three different types of capital within the two different audiences analysed: social, cultural and affective capital.",

    "title": "Contextual social valences for artificial intelligence: anticipation that matters in social work",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In pilot trials, Finnish caseworkers in child welfare services used an AI tool predicting severe risks faced by their clients. Based on interviews with the caseworkers involved, this article draws on those trials to discuss AI valences, or the range of expectations of AI’s value and performance, in social work and beyond. While AI travels across sites of application and sectors of society, its value is often expected to come from the production of anticipatory knowledge. The predictive AI tool used by Finnish caseworkers offers an example: it turned past data about clients into predictions about their future, with an aim of authorizing present interventions to optimize the future. In the pilot trials, however, AI met the practice of social work. In contrast to generic expectations of predictive performance, caseworkers had contextual expectations for AI, reflecting their situated knowledge about their field. For caseworkers, anticipation does not mean producing pieces of speculative knowledge about the future. Instead, for them, anticipation is a professional knowledge-making practice, based on intimate encounters with clients. Caseworkers therefore expect AI to produce contextually relevant information that can facilitate those interactions. This suggests that for AI developments to matter in social work, it is necessary to consider AI not as a tool that produces knowledge outcomes, but one that supports human experts’ knowledge-making processes. More broadly, as AI tools enter new sensitive areas of application, instead of expecting generic value and performance from them, careful attention should be paid on contextual AI valences.",

    "title": "Is the smartphone always a smart choice? Against the utilitarian view of the ‘connected migrant’",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article challenges the widespread view of mobile connectivity as a purely utilitarian resource that refugees use at their individual discretion to resolve problems and cover needs. It explains that while this approach fits into well-intended humanitarian efforts, it carries important empirical and political costs. Both sets of costs are examined. Cues from existing research and an exploratory study among Syrian refugees in the Netherlands reveal the empirical costs: They point to various ways in which mobile connectivity can be both a desired toolkit and an uncomfortable imposition. Although these are novel findings in relation to migration, they resonate with the broader literature on non-utilitarian as well as paradoxical uses of mobile phones. We interpret this gap – between the generalized conceptualizations of the ‘connected refugee’ and people’s experiences of ‘perpetual contact’ more generally – not just as empirically, but also as politically problematic. When refugees’ experiences with mobile phones are simplified, refugees themselves are othered. Critical debates about humanitarianism underscore the dehumanizing politics of this approach and the need to replace the underlying logic of compassion with the defense of refugees’ rights.",

    "title": "Politicians over issues? Visual personalization in three Instagram election campaigns",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The increased use of social media has triggered a visual shift in digital political communication. One central strategy is visual (self-) personalization and many studies have analyzed why and to what extent political communication is focused on individuals. Yet, most research has concentrated on personalization, leaving aside the question of whether it comes at the expense of policy issues or whether people are brought into focus as facilitators of such issues. We fill this research gap by analyzing how visual (self-) personalization on Instagram pages of parties and politicians during election campaigns has changed over time and whether it comes at the cost of addressing policy issues. We use data from three quantitative content analyses of Instagram posts published by parliamentary parties (n = 7) and top candidates (n = 18) in the ‘hot phases’ before three national German elections (N = 2313), covering all nationwide elections since Instagram has become a common campaign tool. It is shown that personal depictions are very common in Instagram campaigns of parties and candidates while addressing policy issues in posts varies between elections. Using a multilevel binomial regression model, we show that addressing policy issues is negatively related to personalization but further analysis shows that it is not a zero-sum game at the cost of addressing policy issues. Our results provide insights into how the presentation of politics might change when image- and video-based platforms continue to gain importance in political communication.",

    "title": "‘When you realise your dad is Cristiano Ronaldo’: celebrity sharenting and children’s digital identities",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Sharenting, or the practice of sharing one’s parenting or information about one’s children on social media, occurs in an increasingly platformized digital culture, where visual formats are central across participatory and commercial repositories. This paper investigates the articulation between sharenting as performed by celebrities and the wider construction of children’s digital identities. Through qualitative content analysis, this research looks at how Cristiano Ronaldo, the most-followed individual on Instagram since 2018, his partner, and his mother shared information about his children on that social media platform between 2018 and 2020. Through manual exploration, we searched for Ronaldo’s children across a variety of digital spaces. Our analysis reveals that sharenting on Instagram engages audiences through the portrayal of children as the parents’ extended self. Content from Instagram and news media is appropriated in vernacular and commercial digital spaces for conflicting affects: the cute father-son dyad, and the son as extension of the uber-famous, vain father. This extreme case shows how the digital identities of children of celebrities are widely public, formed by the everyday, intimate content of the family’s life, which is persistent and collectively recreated by news media, vernacular culture, and commercial platforms.",

    "abstract": "This paper situates current discussions of women's position in ICTs in the wider context of feminist debates on gender and technology. While a common trend among early feminist theorists was a profound pessimism about the inherent masculinity of technology, this was replaced during the 1990s by an unwarranted optimism about the liberating potential of technoscience for women. This article gives an account of both technophobia and technophilia, arguing that recent approaches drawing on the social studies of technology provide a more subtle analysis. Avoiding both technological determinism and gender essentialism, technofeminist approaches emphasize that the gender–technology relationship is fluid and flexible, and that feminist politics and not technology per se is the key to gender equality.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Populism has gained momentum all around the globe. Social media channels contribute to the success of populism by providing an attractive environment for both politicians and ordinary citizens to disseminate their political ideas. Building on previous research, this study argues that attributing blame to culprit others, such as immigrants or the political elites, for causing major societal problems facing the ordinary people is central to populism. By employing a 2 × 2 between-subjects comparative survey experiment, we investigated the effects of these blame attributions in populist online messages on citizens’ exclusionist and anti-establishment populist attitudes in two Western European countries, Austria and the Netherlands (N = 646). Additionally, for the first time in extant research, we distinguished between populist politicians and ordinary citizens as communicators of populist messages. Results revealed that messages blaming the elites or immigrants bolstered citizens’ populist attitudes, but only for those who supported the source of the message. For those who opposed the source, in contrast, populist blame attributions reduced populist attitudes. These findings help us to understand how the core element of pervasive populist messages – attributing blame – affects the populist attitudes of which citizens.",

    "title": "Addressing a volatile subject: adaptive measurement of Australian digital capacities",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Measuring the dynamic shape of digital practices and their near-ubiquitous relationship to daily life is an elusive quest, one that must contend with temporal and relational limits. Research instruments employing categories and indicators struggle with the transient and interconnected character of the digital ‘social fact’. Longitudinal studies pose special difficulties: a 1990s study of browsing and searching would need to be updated to account for the rise of blogging, gaming and media sharing in the 2000s, and again for mobile devices, virtual reality and home automation in the 2010s. Accounting for the volatility of digital life requires, we argue, an adaptive theoretical approach that acknowledges its integral temporal and relational character. We introduce ‘digital capacity’ as the key organising concept for this approach. Alongside the productive capacities of digital objects, the concept doubles as a description of the responsive and generative abilities of digital users. Such capacities are not invariant, and evolve reflexively through multiple sociotechnical milieu: local neighbourhoods, regional configurations of law and infrastructure, and global networks, standards and platforms. Today, capacities respond, for example, to complex arrangements of face-to-face relations, nation-state norms, and the increasing prevalence of mobile devices, telecommunications and platforms. Despite the rapidity and complexity of this change, practitioner and research communities need some stability in definitions and measures of capacities, and we further discuss an approach, based on community indicator work, to research instrument design that admits both comparison and sensitivity to time, place and context. We include illustrative data from a pilot study of Australian digital capacities.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Crowdfunding and other digital mechanisms have the potential to open up cultural production to a broader population. Adopting a spatial approach, we investigate the intermediating role platforms play as a means of considering the debate regarding the egalitarian potential of digital communication. We consider the extent to which platforms relax the tendencies towards the spatial clustering evident in the culture industries through an analysis of two practices: Kickstarter's ‘curated projects’ and ‘badged projects’, which provide some projects with additional promotion. We find that both types of recommended projects tend to cluster in cultural hubs and that they enjoy higher levels of funding than successful projects in general. Rather than relaxing physical constraints on cultural production, Internet platforms reinforce them. We suggest practical steps platforms can take to enhance the egalitarian potential of the markets they set up.",

This paper presents findings from a content analysis in which we coded the amount and kinds of personally identifiable information of public Twitter messages. Overwhelmingly, public Twitter messages do not include identifiable information such as phone numbers, email, and home addresses. Using Goffman's [(1963).

    "title": "COMMUNITY INFORMATICS AND THE LOCAL STATE IN THE UK: Facilitating or assimilating an agenda for change?",
    "abstract": "The emerging discipline of community informatics (CI) has begun to trace out a distinct agenda for change in the social uses of information and communication technologies (ICTs). Focusing upon the appropriation of ICTs by local communities who have been disenfranchised by technological development, this agenda foregrounds uses of the Internet in the pursuit of distinctly community-related objectives. However, the role that the local state ought to play within this agenda for change remains marked by a degree of controversy and ambiguity. Assertions of the need for community autonomy coexist uneasily with a recognition that the local state can help develop and sustain CI. Much current work therefore focuses upon exploring notions of ‘partnership’ between the local state and local groups in developing CI. Against this background, this paper draws on a case study of Birmingham City Council (BCC) in order to explore a series of significant organizational changes to local government, which have seen BCC adopt a fundamentally new ‘community leadership’ role. This shift to community leadership is being expedited by innovative uses of Internet technology. It is argued that, rather than straightforwardly re-creating BCC as a better partner to community groups in developing CI, such changes are deeply paradoxical. In the first instance shifts to community leadership have enabled BCC to develop valuable web resources that enhance their role as a partner facilitating citizen-led CI. Conversely, however, these changes are bound up in a broader attempt by BCC to reassert managerial control at a time when its legitimacy as a social institution is being questioned. Faced with a series of external challenges, BCC has replicated important CI activities in the pursuit of its own interests. Ultimately it is argued that this assimilation of CI could eventually undermine the broader CI agenda for change.",

Academic, media and daily lives discourses tend to ask three questions about Google. First, what other services does Google provide in addition to a search engine? Second, is Google an unconventional company? Third, does Google provide free information? By examining the development of Google Maps and Google Earth from an historical perspective, and by situating technological development in a broader socioeconomic context, the paper argues that Google employs a wide array of strategies to stay competitive in the information industry.",

    "title": "CHARTING THE LUDODROME The mediation of urban and simulated space and rise of the<i>flâneur electronique</i>",
    "abstract": "Urban spaces have become blended even more seamlessly with their portrayal. Such representations are generated via a broad range of media which both influence and sculpt our sense of their constitution so that our sense of what the urban ‘is’ is inflected by a range of interpretations, atmospheres, inherited viewpoints, dialogues and scenarios derived from these media. In this paper this interpretive skew is looked at as generated through intense video gaming activity and from a particular simulated urban context, the city of the game Grand Theft Auto 3: Liberty City. The objective is to conceptualize the linkages between gamers' apprehension of the relative realism of this in-game environment and its influence on their experience of traversing ‘real’ urban environments. The authors suggest the notions of slipped and segued viewpoints as a means of understanding the differential degrees to which real and artificial interactive representations, based around violence, gang ecologies and dystopian urban space, bleed unevenly into the everyday urban life of these players. This sense of space appears to influence perceptions of risk, the navigation of urban space, and received understandings of social ecologies and stereotypes which overlap with the non-game world. Gamers move within what the authors call the ludodrome – a mediated space between immersion in urban simulation and a real world that is simultaneously generated, destabilized and blurred by the effect of such gameplay.",

    "abstract": "Our series on privacy, surveillance, trust and regulation continues in this number with Adam Warren & James Dearnley’s account of the formation of data protection legislation in the United Kingdom a generation ago. This article takes us down a route travelled in previous numbers of this journal with the publication of Joseph Fitsanakis’s (2003) and Bert-Jaap Koops’s (2003) studies of historical aspects of communications interception, in that it, too, assembles historical material which casts light on the formation of processes and systems in and around privacy invasion and protection. The story of data protection in the UK has been written about before, but Warren & Dearnley unearth new sources and investigate the public record in order to provide a clearer picture of the politics of regulation and the episodes of obstruction along the road to the establishment of principles, rules, and machinery for controlling what happens to personal data. The policy records of other countries also yield accounts which could be compared with that of the UK (e.g. Regan, 1995). In this context, Bennett’s (1992) and Flaherty’s (1989) comparisons of the USA, UK, Germany, France, Canada and Sweden remain seminal examples of how investigations of the policy process for ‘regulating privacy’ can lead us to think about explanations for differences and similarities. But they can also trigger enquiries about the roles and interactions of individuals, governmental or state organizations and pressure groups in mediating regulatory outcomes. In the case of UK data protection, the central role played by Sir Norman Lindop and his committee is highlighted by Warren & Dearnley. The Lindop report, referred to in the article, helped to advance the argument for a strong regulatory regime, but its recommendations were politically unpalatable. Lindop’s report is worth revisiting for its detailed survey of what was, even in the 1970s, the extensive collection, storage and sharing of personal data in many sectors, including policing and other important public services, and for its delineation of the important issues and possible regulatory routes.",

    "abstract": "In 2001, the International Olympic Committee awarded the hosting rights of the 2008 summer games to Beijing, thereby beginning a process which revealed for much of the world the multitudinous ways in which the games interact with politics, culture, and commerce, in ways that have not been so strikingly evident in other recent games. Multiple competing narratives were articulated by a host of global organizations, including the IOC, the Beijing Organizing Committee of the Olympic Games (BOCOG), foreign governments, and NGOs, and these narratives could never be reconciled. While China sought to use the games as a grand epic of the nation’s re-emergence as a global power, activists sought to link the games explicitly to the 1936 Berlin Games, which Adolph Hitler had used for propaganda purposes. Moreover, NGOs sought to wrest control even of the slogans, so that the games’s slogan ‘one world, one dream’ became ‘one world, one nightmare’. This book, which emerged from a conference convened by the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg School for Communication and the Communication University of China, explores the Beijing Olympic games and the multiple narratives, from the perspective of a ‘media event’, or occasions in which the business of the world is broadcast to a global audience. In building upon this theoretical construct, the various authors aim to expand upon and revise our understanding of media events, while also helping to explain the larger political and social meanings that are imposed upon the Olympics. Political controversy is not new to the games, the Olympic ‘movement’, or the IOC which passionately guards the meaning of the games. Indeed, the political meaning of the Olympics has always been to ‘transcend politics’, while at the same time scoring points for whichever ideology one holds dear. But the Beijing games have galvanized positions all across the spectrum, from zealous Chinese patriots to the Students for a Free Tibet, which was running open advertisements asking Olympic competitors to publicly shame the Beijing government, hopefully after winning a gold medal. The various essays presented here do attempt to catch some of the rich political and cultural discourse emerging from the games (the essays by Jacques DeLisle and Monroe Price are especially valuable), but the fact that some of the most interesting",

    "abstract": "This research examined the extent to which the introduction of communications media triggered shifts in broader structural arrangements as enacted in the distribution of power and as signalled by patterns of language use. It sampled the ongoing communications between the North American managers of an international aid and peace organization and their direct reports located in Africa, as the medium changed from couriered letters to facsimiles to electronic mail over a 12-year period. Differences in hierarchical position and communication medium influenced linguistic choices, which, in turn, formed a complex pattern characterized by a dialectic of control in which there was ongoing tension between autonomy and dependency.",

    "title": "Taking risks when communicating on the Internet: the role of offline social-psychological factors in young people's vulnerability to online risks",
    "abstract": "Children and young people encounter a range of risks on the internet relating to communication. Making friends online has attracted particular attention as a risky behaviour, especially when this leads to offline meetings, as has giving out personal information online. This article, based on the ‘UK Children Go Online’ survey, seeks to explain the online communication of 9–19-year-olds in terms of their offline socio-psychological characteristics (shyness, life satisfaction, risk-taking), family communication patterns and online behaviour/skills. Findings show that older teens engage in more online communication activities than do younger children and so encounter more communication risks. Although girls communicate more on the internet, this seems not to put them more at risk. It was found that children's offline social psychological characteristics, particularly their levels of life satisfaction and risk-taking, influence their online communication, with different online communication activities being predicted by different patterns of off- and online characteristics. There are weak indications that, in families which have a more conversational style of communication, teens may take fewer risks online, including a lower likelihood of meeting online friends offline. Multiple regression analyses show that those children and teens who are less satisfied with their lives and who have become more frequent and skilled internet users are more likely to value the internet as a communicative environment in which they feel more confident than they do offline, particularly in relation to the potential for anonymous communication. Since this in turn leads some into risky activities, the implications for research and policy are discussed.",

A survey of early adopters identified three differences across these countries, each potentially affecting adoption: funding approaches, the technical configuration of projects, and research support. Our findings also suggest that the sustainable adoption of e-Infrastructure co-varies with the role of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations and the involvement of other people in the adoption decision.",

    "title": "Women behaving badly: negative posts on Facebook memorial pages",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This study explores negative posts in Facebook pages dedicated to dead subjects. As with places for mourning in offline environments, memorial pages in Facebook appear to exude a sacred character as objects to both celebrate the life of the deceased and grieve their departure with others. Through a two-step content analysis of an initial sample of 600 pages containing the ‘R.I.P.’ acronym in their title, we found, however, a number of posts violating conventional expectations of respect for these mourning spaces. Negative posts in memorial pages take the form of flames (i.e., insults directed at the subject of the page, its administrator, or other visitors), venting (e.g., violent language against the victimizers of the subject of a memorial page), or ‘spam’ (i.e., advertisement and content not related to the subject and purpose of the page). Moreover, while results show that most memorial pages in Facebook are created and maintained by women (even thought the subject in the majority of those pages are young males who died an untimely death), they also reveal that women post the majority of negative posts in those pages as well. In other words, whereas women seem to perpetuate traditional offline roles in connection to mourning and grieving rituals, in the online world, they are also the first ones challenging the socially sanctioned sacral attributes of those practices in social networking sites.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Our contemporary life is an intertwined arrangement of ‘Life’ with digital technologies. Increasingly, we are seeing the prevalence of automation and machines, predominantly through artificial intelligence (AI), as a means to make sense of our worlds, engage with our employers, understand the political system and interact with our social lives as some of the key methods among a wide variety of other interpersonal communication processes. Not only are these often machine-based activities seen through digital communication itself, but also in the surrounding regulatory systems, the growing concerns of digital inequality, the act of datafication, and the infrastructures that enable and inhibit digital communication. These are some of the key themes that emerged from the selected papers in this special issue emerging from the 2020 Association of Internet Researchers (AoIR) conference, entirely held online and themed around ‘Life’. In this special issue, we present seven papers from senior and emerging scholars within Asia, Europe, Africa, and North and South America that address and unpack the contemporary moment of communication in our Life. The papers in this special issue discuss chatbots, games, smart lighting, wearables, doorbells, sensors, biometrics, and facial recognition technology - – very much everyday technologies that shape many of our lives. They ground our expectations of AI and highlight the importance of context in internet research.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT A common risk among adolescents is sexual solicitation, in which an adolescent is asked to provide sexual information, engage in sexual talk, or in sexual activities. Although scholars increasingly address this topic from an intrapersonal perspective, there is little attention to factors of language use and message content. In two focus group studies, we investigated whether adolescent girls consider themselves capable of assessing whether an online stranger is an adult or a peer, the extent to which adolescent girls actually succeed in making this assessment, the strategies they apply to do so, and the content- and language-related cues focused on. Our findings suggest that most of the adolescent girls are confident in their ability to assess whether the stranger is a peer or an adult with possible sexual intentions. However, we also found that only 43% were able to correctly make this assessment. Most of the adolescents seem to apply the passive strategy of uncertainty reduction: They scan the profile page of the stranger, check contact information, and the profile picture. They may choose to apply the interactive strategy to find out more about the online stranger. Important content-related cues that alarm adolescent girls are: ignoring personal questions, showing an exaggerated amount of interest, acting as a friend, and being sexually oriented. Language cues mentioned related to word usage, abbreviations, sentence length, and tone.",

    "abstract": "The celebrated confrontation between Nixon and Kennedy in the run up to the 1960 American Presidential Election have become entrenched in the folklore of television history – indeed such was the reaction of politicians to their perceived impact they remained off screen until 1976. Since then, for all the protracted discussions about format and structure, they have become an intrinsic part of Presidential and Election politics. Paradoxically, notwithstanding the debate about the debate in 1997, British Electoral Politics at the highest level has remained reluctant to allow voters to see the merits of candidates debating matters on television, the quintessential medium of contemporary electoral politics. In one sense the contrast between those democracies which since the late 1970s have increasingly embraced the televised debate as a key dynamic within the decision-making process and the UK, which remains aloof, lies at the heart of this illuminating and informative study. From the  rst chapter, when Stephen Coleman asserts that ‘it makes no more sense to speak of a non-debating democracy than a non-voting democracy’ (p. 1), the book is underpinned by a reformist impulse. This argues that the televised debate between the main protagonists should become an integral part of British electoral politics, in the interests of voter information, participation and the democratic process itself. In this vein, both Richard Holme and Austin Mitchell (chapters 5 and 6) attempt to explain why Britain remains an exception, Mitchell claiming that in 1997 ‘both parties promised, neither wanted to deliver’ (p. 116). Similarly the study concludes (chapter 11) with Julie Hall’s impassioned plea that a democratic decit and voter apathy can be addressed if technology is harnessed to promote ‘informed citizens, becoming ongoing participants in the democratic process’ (p. 179). Both to support these demands for change in the UK, and as an academic study in its own right, the book draws upon a number of case studies in order to elucidate the history and contemporary practises surrounding televised election debates. These case studies focus on differing perspectives; the politician’s angle is provided by Helen Clark (chapter 7), giving a perceptive insight into her role as Labour Party Leader participating in the televised debates during the 1996 New Zealand elections. She concludes that ‘leaders had to win and be seen to win on television’ (p. 125). In chapter 8, Arnold Amber examines the Canadian experience from a television producer’s point of view, signi cantly stating that no",

    "title": "EXPLORING TIME USE",
    "abstract": "Usage of technologies, it has been argued, creates social and political malaise. Television was perceived to be the first culprit and it seems that the internet is being dubbed as the ‘new television’. As such, this paper focuses on the relationship between internet usage and time spent with friends and family, as well as other associational activities. A secondary concern is the impact of internet usage on traditional media usage, namely watching television and reading newspapers. By critiquing methods and results in this area, and by offering further empirical evidence, it will be argued that the internet has yet to have a significant impact on time use in social life. Using Home Online (HoL) data, and employing factor analysis and lagged regression models, it will be demonstrated that some negative, marginal effects appear to have taken place in terms of reducing bonding social capital. It will also be demonstrated that counter-intuitive positive effects appear to have taken place in terms of reading newspapers. Given the negative time elasticity effects of internet usage on seeing close friends as well as some domestic activities, analyses of the internet's impact on relationships within the home, that is, family life, should be the focus of future research in this field.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores inclusive research design (IRD) as an integral component in what we term community partnership research in the information management and systems field. It aims to unravel the challenges and complexities of the double hermeneutic spiral associated with designing and doing this type of research in order to identify principles and processes appropriate to the engagement of all partners – in the community that provides the setting for the research and in the academy – in the iterative, ongoing design of the research. The research reported in the paper was undertaken within an interpretivist framework, using literary warrant analysis, autoethnography and a second generation grounded theory approach to data analysis. It involved in-depth analysis of our experiences over the last 10 years in community partnership research relating to smart health information portals, including reflection on our particular roles and interests in the research, as well as our changing needs, values and expectations. The paper concludes by presenting an IRD framework for community partnership research in information management and systems.",

    "title": "Digital survivance and Trickster humor: exploring visual and digital Indigenous epistemologies in the #NoDAPL movement",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The decolonizing turn in the humanities and social sciences calls for scholarship that analyzes social media practices through the lens of Indigenous epistemologies. In this article, we model the ways that Indigenous epistemologies might contribute to theories of social media practices as we explore ways that the digital image can drive identification with and engagement in political acts. The article analyzes social media tropes circulated across various platforms among Indigenous communities and allies in relation to the #NoDAPL movement. We argue that attempting to analyze Native American traditions through Western theory will only work towards colonizing these Indigenous texts. Thus, whereas we employ insights from digital and visual methods of analysis (Highfield, T., & Leaver, T. (2016). Instagrammatics and digital methods: Studying visual social media, from selfies and GIFs to memes and emoji. Communication Research and Practice, 2(1), 47–62), we also highlight the strategic use of humor in the visual materials shared through various social media platforms utilizing the framework of the Trickster. We argue that the visual and digital phenomena we studied might best be understood as a form of digital survivance, drawing upon Anishinaabe scholar Gerald Vizenor [(1994). Manifest manners: Postindian warriors of survivance. Hanover, CT: Wesleyan University Press]. term ‘survivance’ as a portmanteau that combines ‘survival’ and ‘resistance’ in its characterization of Indigenous storytelling traditions. Whereas centering the Indigenous figure of the Trickster might suggest that social media has failed to live up to its promises, this epistemological approach also explains the hope that Indigenous communities hold in uniting via social media for what has been and continues to be a long-term battle for sovereignty and for the protection of the earth and all of its beings.",

    "abstract": "Computers are technologies of control, and issues of control have always  gured prominently in discussions about their societal dimensions (Wiener 1948). Computerization has changed the socio-technical con guration of control, both in terms of how it is exercised, and what it can be applied to. However, there is no consensus how to assess these changes, in part because technologies and applications are dynamic, and in part because many contributions to this discussion are pushed in opposite directions by their, often implicit, bias of social or technological determinism. These diverging perspectives are exempli ed by two books with the same title: ‘Control Revolution’. In 1986, James R. Beniger analysed the early history of the Information Society, from the late nineteenth century up to the development of mainframe computers. He viewed the automation of information processing as centralization and extension of managerial control over ever more complex industrial processes. In fact, new technologies, he argued, stabilized hierarchical structures that were threatened by their own growth. A little more than a decade later, in 1999, Andrew L. Shapiro purported that the control revolution was going in a different direction. He was concerned that networked computers were decentralizing control too much. He feared that individuals would become able to control and customize their experience of the world (i.e. by tailoring the news they receive) to such a degree that social cohesion would be threatened. While Beniger stressed the intended consequences of computerization, Shapiro pondered its unintended effects. Beniger found technological development to be closely aligned with, and directly responding to, corporate strategies, whereas Shapiro found that the effects of technologies were unplanned and unmanaged, and therefore affected society in ways that were not anticipated or necessarily desired. Lawrence Lessig, a professor at the Stanford Law School, takes up Shapiro’s treatment of the control revolution. However, Lessig maintains that the decentralization of control that characterized the Internet’s development up until the late 1990s was a social effect caused by deliberate decisions about technological design. Since then, these decisions have been deliberately reversed, and a new Internet architecture threatens to push control back into the domain of large",

    "abstract": "This book is an overdue attempt to bring a feminist perspective to bear on the problems and theories addressed by the field of computer ethics. It shows clearly that information and communication technology (ICT) does not neutralize gender inequalities but may often entrench or enhance them, for example, in the cases of online sexual harassment and cyber-stalking. Alison Adam makes a strong case that computer ethics has signally failed to engage in any depth with feminist theory and has adopted an approach to gender that is profoundly undertheorized and often politically naı̈ve in its failure to recognize the importance of the relationship between gender and power. Adam therefore aims to develop a feminist critique and ethical framework to redress these failures. She adopts a multidisciplinary approach drawing on traditional moral and political philosophy, computer ethics itself, feminist political and legal theory, and feminist ethics. In a world of specialization Adam also reflects on the peculiar difficulties of adopting such a multidisciplinary approach. The book weaves together four important themes: technological determinism; liberalism; power; and the relationship between the public and private spheres. Technological determinism is often an implicit assumption in much writing on the relationship between ICT and society and as such compromises the understanding of choice as fundamental to moral agency and the possibilities for more equal and just societies. Similarly Adam argues that classical liberalism fails adequately to deal with gender and inequality – manifest for example in the use of liberal arguments in the context of the Internet to promote the legitimacy of pornography. At the same time liberalism often obscures the deep power structures that influence the design, introduction, diffusion and use of ICT. Finally, Adam provides a powerful analysis of privacy that runs through a series of case studies on data protection, cyberstalking, Internet pornography, hacking and surveillance. These studies move beyond traditional computer ethics’ analyses to expose the core gender inequalities that are reproduced in technological contexts. Women speaking out on the Internet, for example, are often perceived as transgressive in that they appear to be moving from their ‘natural’ domestic sphere into the male public sphere. One of the many strengths of this book is the blending of conceptual themes with reviews of empirical research on, for example, women’s access to computer",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to examine how members of an online bulletin board group concerned with sleep paralysis (SP) use the Internet to establish what it means to experience the symptoms associated with a mysterious sleep disorder. Data from 646 posts to the bulletin board, and from ten in- depth interviews with select bulletin board users, revealed that board participants constructed their disorder in three different ways: while some considered it a purely physiological problem, others believed it to be a demonic attack or a paranormal phenomenon. Results indicated that people suffering from SP are driven to the Internet by their desire to make sense of their terrifying nocturnal experiences. Rather than dispelling the myths surrounding this sleep disorder, the Internet in this study was, however, found to reinforce them by offering a forum for the discussion of alternative explanatory frameworks.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In this symposium contribution, Dave Karpf offers three observations about the differences between the fields of social movement studies and political communication. He posits that the central difference between the two is the relative lack of a canonical literature in political communication. He discusses how this lack of a canon can be particularly freeing and generative during a time of rapid media change. He also examines the trend toward methodological pluralism and the rise of a robust experimental tradition in political communication. Finally, he discusses how cross-disciplinary research on movements and media as interacting systems can be further expanded and developed for the digital age.",

    "abstract": "Drotner and Livingstone’s attempt to bring media into childhood studies in order to shed light into the long neglected and forgotten link between children and media is one that engages both the contributors and potential readers to many aspects of sociology of childhood and media studies. The International Handbook of Children, Media and Culture fulfils the expectation of those familiar with the literature around children and media through incorporating aspects that have been overlooked before. It comes at a time when scholars both in the field of sociology of childhood and media studies have been looking for a merging point between the two fields that not only takes full account of critical theories of media and communication but also encompasses an account of childhood studies from a sociological perspective rather than a clinical developmental psychology point of view. The book offers a wide range of perspectives within the sociology of childhood and is a must read for anyone who is interested in childhood. Also those who are interested in media literacy, consumerism, cultural studies and critique of media would find the book extremely useful in terms of its inclusion of children and the youth as active members of the audience. Due to its multi-disciplinary nature, the book would be of interest to scholars and students from across the social sciences and studies regardless of their prior knowledge of the fields. The editors’ introductions to each part not only link the running themes of the book but also work towards providing the readers who might be unfamiliar to the field with an understating of the themes and discussions. In addition, some of the chapters by key authors in their fields such as Prout, Lemish and Buckingham also provide a comprehensive cover of the literature while familiarizing the reader with the traditional and current discussions on their topics and also introduce the reader to the essential theoretical underpinnings. The collection of essays put together by Drotner and Livingstone in this volume are presented in a thematic order in which the reader can find informative and analytical background literature into childhood studies and media’s take on children in the first part. The following parts each provide insightful essays on",

    "title": "Cyberspace Odyssey: Towards a Virtual Ontology and Anthropology",
    "abstract": "Throughout the late 1990s, ‘cyberspace’ became a key point of interest in sociology, media theory and certain strands of anthropology. There were fierce debates over what would become of our identities, our friendships, our sense of place, and even our bodies in the then dazzling new world of online communication, networked relationships and virtual reality. Such debates were accompanied by a renewed interest in questions of being, or ontology, and by concerns over what it would mean to be human in an age of seemingly ‘intelligent’ media. Cyberspace Odyssey returns to many of these themes. It centres on the following questions: first, ‘how to understand cyberspace’; second, ‘in what way does this new matrix of space-time affect our understanding of the world and ourselves?’ and third, ‘how far will our odyssey through cyberspace actually change our world and ourselves?’ (p. 15). Jos de Mul addresses these questions by exploring a wide-range of topics, including: the digitalization of culture (Chapter 6); interactive cinema and digital photography (Chapters 5 and 8); and identity construction in the age of the Internet (Chapter 10), to name but a few. The problem is that many of these topics, including the concern with ‘cyberspace’, now feel a little time-worn. Many things have changed since the 1990s, particularly following the emergence of mobile computational devices and social networking sites that today are almost ubiquitous in everyday life. Such changes are registered, but are never dealt with in detail in this book. Chapter 10, for example, refers to the advent of Web 2.0 and to applications such as Skype and YouTube, but only in brief, and as a consequence the ontological significance of such developments is left largely unexplored. Instead, the author makes a number of statements that may once have been profound, but are now pretty much self-evident. For example: ‘The World Wide Web differs from older multimedia like television or film in that all applied media share a digital code’ (p. 183). Or: ‘Webpages not seldom contain elements that previously belonged mainly to the personal sphere, such as diary-like notes, travelogues, photos from private life, etc.’ (p. 186). Coupled with this, there are important scholarly writings on being and ontology in the digital age that do not feature in this book.",

    "title": "'The Culture of Efficiency: Technology in Everyday Life' edited by Sharon Kleinman",
    "abstract": "This book offered me an unexpected, albeit not surprising, insight to begin with: that book titles create expectations that are not always met. This is not, because the book’s title – The Culture of Efficiency: Technology in Everyday Life (edited by Sharon Kleinman) – was a bad or wrong description of its content – quite the opposite – but because I thought I knew enough about ‘the field’ in order to know what to expect from the title. As it turned out, I was very wrong. This serves to underline an important point concerning ‘The Culture of Efficiency’: it is indeed an insightful, at times surprising, book, which does not necessarily just cover the ‘usual’ topics related to the question of technology in everyday life. Instead, it is a book that is very good at raising issues that are otherwise often overlooked. Hence, there are articles about stalking (Leisring), about disabilities (Benarska) and about communication in catastrophic situations (Marlow & Giles). Other articles deal with issues such as the McDonald’s Snack Wrap in Japan (Maynard) or architecture, transport and other such issues, i.e. a wide range of technologies and everyday situations come into play. This list is simply to illustrate not only the range of technologies, but thereby also of contributions. One aspect that many of them share is that they are often empirically based – and even practical. The range of approaches is also reflected in the choice of titles for the different parts: ‘Birth Eat Connect’; ‘Work Play Rest’; ‘Speed Multitask Displace’ and ‘Balance Breathe Renew’. My ‘misreading’ of the title was based on my emphasis on the second part rather than the first. Instead, this is in fact a book about the culture of efficiency. The overtone of the book as a whole is critical towards the notion of efficiency and many of the diverse versions of its culture that the authors have analysed. This overtone is both appropriate and useful in this context. One can feel the personal engagement that many authors bring to the topic – not a very common feature in academic writing, but one that seems suitable in this context. Overall, the edited collection left me with the feeling of having read something a bit out of the ordinary. Not every contribution was as good as the other",

    "abstract": "This paper evaluates the dominant perspectives for understanding e-democracy in practice. It argues that although these, on their own, only provide static and partial accounts of the role and implications of e-democracy, nevertheless they should not be disregarded. The paper proposes an integration of their key positions to generate a more rounded and complete account of the role of e-democracy in practice. It suggests that Giddens's Structuration Theory provides a starting point in this direction. A structuration perspective is able to integrate many of the diverse perspectives whilst simultaneously avoiding technological and social determinism by focusing attention on the interplay of social structures and agency in e-democracy practices. This perspective assists in illuminating the underlying institutional arrangements and structures in which e-democracy practices are embedded, as well as the strategies employed by human actors. It focuses attention on structures of signification, domination and legitimation that surround e-democracy practices and also how individuals are both enabled and constrained in these practices. It is argued that more complete and balanced accounts which emerge from such an integrated perspective could assist in developing a more effective e-democracy policy.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In this paper, we use trolling to illuminate the entangled and complex relationship between online debate, technological infrastructure, and justice. While a great deal of research has investigated the harmful effects of trolling in the form of cyberbullying and online harassment, attention to the infrastructure of trolling can provide new insights into information flows within digital infrastructure, and consequently, bears on questions such as access to, and quality of, information; the status and credibility of knowledge claims and claimants; and about the gatekeepers of knowledge and information. We show how trolling takes advantage of the rapidity of information transmission and reproduction; technical illiteracy; automation; and ‘soft’ infrastructure such as conventions, protocols, etiquette, and rules governing online communities to affect informational justice using a methodologically symmetrical approach.",

    "title": "Vocations, visions and vitalities of data analysis. An introduction",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Vocations and visions are vital to data analyses: without them, there is neither data, nor analysis. Visions are the solutions that technology designers and data analysts strive towards, and vocations are those callings that data follows spontaneously in the course of the analytic process. In data analyses, vocations and visions can take mathematical, semiotic or other social forms. Due to the integration of data analyses with digital technologies, however, vocations and visions are increasingly hard to grasp. Contributions to this issue identify the vocations and visions of data analyses as we find them in thermal cameras, in wearables for aid and medical treatment, in financial platforms, search engines, software and algorithms. They also trace how vocations and visions become productive of social and biological life and are therefore not only vitally important to data analysis, but also vital because they co-produce and re-ontologize life. They shape commercial, intellectual and social spheres, as well as the body, biology and bare life. Data analyses interact with human lives as data and analytic tools become lively, too. When applied to human beings and other organic life forms, to analytic tools, to digital data and to their relationship of becoming with each other, a methodology of life cycles captures these dynamics. If we acknowledge the vocations, visions and vitalities involved, analyses of data analysis must be conducted to help us understand, relate to and navigate these strange and familiar agencies.",

    "abstract": "ogy can be useful – as long as both preventive and not absolute – there are high barriers to its institutionalization. It raises privacy and ethical issues: there is no universal way to see the faces. The risk is to create disembodied identites. Today people are ever more known through electronic information. The social representation of human beings comes about within a system based for the most part on electronics. These transformations end up involving the anthropology of people as well, through modification of their bodies, creating people who are ‘configured’ with their electronic data. In this way the individuality instead risks being translated into a simple binary code. This is an intelligent and invisible surveillance not so much and not only because it is carried out with detection systems that are, by now, in place everywhere or with hidden video cameras, but principally because of the invisible nature of the processes of categorization, social selection and classification that are undertaken technologically.

    "abstract": "understood. For example, Henry et al found no association between BCH and age while Anim et al found the prevalence of BCH to increase with aging. Conversely, Thorson et al found an association between BCH and younger age which agrees with our findings. Other patient factors such as race, BMI, PSA levels, DRE, prostate volume, and geographic region were not associated with BCH. Similar results were obtained by Henry et al who found no correlation between BCH and PSA levels, prostate volume, medical treatments, or comorbidities. However, in our study BCH was associated with more histological prostate atrophy and acute inflammation and less chronic inflammation. Contrariwise, Thorson et al, found BCH to be associated with lymphocytic (chronic) inflammatory infiltrate in most cases. Given the conflicting results on the factors associated with BCH, further studies evaluating the potential causes of BCH are warranted. The relationship of BCH in prostate biopsies with LUTS and prostatitis-related symptoms is unknown. Yang et al postulated that basal cell proliferation was present in almost all subjects who underwent surgery for BPH/LUTS while Henry et al found BCH in only 13 subjects of the 141 prostate TURP and open prostatectomy specimens evaluated. In our study, we found no association between BCH in the peripheral zone with prostate volume or IPSS score. This suggests that BCH found in the peripheral zone is not associated with BPH or LUTS while BCH in the transitional zone may be associated with BPH and LUTS, though this requires further study. Previous studies have suggested BCH could be a metaplastic reaction to injury and in some cases may progress to basal cell carcinoma. However, this hypothesis has been contested in multiple studies. For example, Thorson et al demonstrated that the presence of BCH in peripheral zone was associated with lower PCa risk. In addition, they did not find any topographical association between BCH and PCa in prostate specimens. Similarly, a study by Benett et al failed to demonstrate PCa development in patients diagnosed with BCH. In our study, PCa at the 2-year repeat biopsy was unrelated to baseline BCH. Thus, although it seems that BCH is unrelated to PCa, further studies evaluating the molecular changes associated with BCH and how they correlated with prostate carcinogenesis are needed. Our study has several strengths including its large, multicentric sample with central pathology review by 2 independent pathologists. Nonetheless, it has some limitations. First, subjects with severe LUTS (IPPS >= 25 or 20 among those on alpha-blocker) and prostate volume >80 cm were excluded and only men with baseline PSA values between 2.5 and 10 ng/dl were included. Second, those with atypical small acinar proliferation, HGPIN, or previous prostate surgery were also excluded. Third, we did not evaluate subtypes of BCH, including typical and atypical. Finally, the prevalence of BCH was low, which reduced our statistical power.",

    "title": "Are digital platforms potential drivers of the populist vote? A comparative analysis of France, Germany and Italy",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Populist parties are often argued to be very skilled in using digital media to attract supporters and strengthen linkages with their followers. However, only rarely has research shown this linkage empirically. This study explores whether arguments about the relation between digital platforms and populist voting can be substantiated using comparative survey data in France, Germany and Italy. Digital media include a variety of online platforms that can affect populist vote in different ways. This article addresses the relation between the political use of digital platforms and the populist vote. First, it looks at how the use of Social Networking Sites (SNS) and Mobile Instant Messaging Services (MIMS) is related to voting for populist parties. Second, it assesses whether the role of digital platforms is different for supporting digital ‘immigrant’ and digital ‘native’ populist parties. Third, it explores country differences in the relation between SNS and MIMS’ use and the populist vote. Using original online surveys, the article shows that political activities on SNS and MIMS platforms (sending messages or posting, discussing or convincing others to vote for a candidate) increase the probability of voting for populist parties. However, it also finds that the political use of digital media is associated with the populist vote under certain (and limited) circumstances, that is only for a subset of populist parties. Finally, it identifies important differences in how SNS and MIMS are linked to the populist vote in countries presenting diverse institutional features, web regulations and constellations of media systems.",

    "abstract": "Findings from an in-depth study of problems faced by the UK e-Research community – researchers, institutionally based support services and national e-Infrastructure service providers – as they struggle with the challenges of widening the adoption of e-Infrastructure, exploiting its potential benefits and embedding it into everyday research practices are presented. The findings show that e-Infrastructure is often seen by users (both current and potential) as complex and challenging. It is also clear that current users often experience frustrations, while potential users may be unaware of its benefits and of how to take the first steps towards exploiting them. The findings highlight the scale of problems arising from the failure of the human infrastructure – the networks (both formal and informal) of actors essential to effective exploitation of innovations – to develop and keep pace with the technical infrastructure. The article concludes by discussing a number of interventions that the e-Research community might make in order to re-align the capabilities of the human infrastructure with those of the technical infrastructure.",

    "title": "‘Kids, these YouTubers are stealing from you’: influencers and online discussions about taxes",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article's main aim is to analyse public discourses about tax avoidance in Spain by studying the scandal stirred up by the announcement by ElRubius (the most popular YouTuber in Spain, with 40.3 million subscribers) that he was moving to Andorra to pay lower taxes. To fulfil this aim, we use thematic analysis to study the most viewed and commented videos posted on YouTube by both YouTubers and the traditional media, as well as their comments sections, to identify how taxes are defined, how YouTubers and their audiences are portrayed and what forms of identification these stories offer. Our results show that ElRubius’ announcement sparked a polarised debate. On the one hand, traditional media framed the debate as a moral one, attacked ElRubius using a ‘naming and shaming’ strategy and defended redistributive taxes as a means of financing public services and achieving wealth redistribution. On the other hand, YouTubers defended a neoliberal agenda by portraying taxes as a burden, promoting self-interest and denouncing the Spanish state as too big, inefficient and corrupt. The analysis of the comments shows how the traditional media strategy of shaming ElRubius failed, as audiences mostly identified with him and endorsed the discourse of YouTubers who defended him. Thus, although the welfare state is still very much legitimised in Spain, we can see how new hegemonies are being created and promoted in the context of social media.",

    "title": "Australian young people's participatory practices and internet use",
    "abstract": "This paper examines the relationship between Internet use and political participation among Australian young people. Based on original survey data it demonstrates that there clearly exists a ‘digital divide’ amongst 18–34-year-old Australians, which is delineated on demographic characteristics of geography, education level, income level and occupational classification. While the Internet has far from replaced the traditional information sources of television and newspapers, it does, however, facilitate participation undertaken by already politically engaged young people. The Internet has fundamental importance in facilitating information sharing and organizing for young people involved in activist and community groups. The paper also provides case studies of two non-government, youth-oriented organizations with participatory Internet sites (Vibewire Youth Services and Inspire Foundation) to further explore the potential of Internet enhancement of young people's autonomous political spaces. One site provides Internet-only, youth-specific mental health services and has developed a portal for active community-based participation. It has won commendations for encouraging youth ownership of service provision and providing space for youth participation. The other site provides discussion and journalism for and by young people on a range of cultural, social and political issues. This site also engages in mainstream political issues through ‘electiontracker’, which provided four young people with the opportunity to join the mainstream media in following and reporting on the 2004 Australian federal election campaign. The focus in this paper on heterogenous acts of participation is able to expand our understanding of the democratizing potential of young people's Internet-based political practices.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In China, the live-streaming industry boasts 587 million users worth 961 billion yuan in 2020 [Yimei Zixun (2021, 16 March). 2020–2021 Zhongguo zaixian zhibo hangye niandu yanjiu baogao. https://www.163.com/dy/article/G57R8DN00511A1Q1.html]. With so many live-streamers clamoring for fame and fortune, the sheer competition catalyzes the rise of ‘live-streaming guilds’ (zhibo gonghui) that help members elevate themselves in the performance charts of the various live-streaming apps. In this article, we conducted ethnographic research in one such guild that contracted its business from the live-streaming platform Zhubei. By conceptualizing these guilds as collectives of manipulating ‘algorithmic experts’ [Bishop, S. (2020). Algorithmic experts: Selling algorithmic lore on YouTube. Social Media + Society, 6(1), 1–11. https://doi.org/10.1177/2056305119897323], we argue that they optimize their live-streamers’ performance according to algorithmic parameters that the platforms themselves reveal. However, guilds manipulate audience affects more, going so far as to use heterosexual male workers to masquerade as female live-streamers to entice straight male audience members to tip generously. As such, we challenge the still-prevalent epistemological assumption that live-streamers work alone, and the received wisdom that platform algorithms are unknown and unknowable.",

    "abstract": "This article, based on a computer-assisted analysis of Weibo communications about two recent ‘mass incidents’ in China, offers a model for understanding online communication's influence on government legitimacy. This study explores the discourse of Weibo discussions on social protests and what impacts this discourse may have on the legitimacy of Chinese government in the digital environment. The Weibo discourses on the two mass incidents suggest two modes of online communication: one-way communication, where local residents have taken the initiative and two-way communication, initiated by both local residents and national elites. Different themes the discourses have touched suggest different types and levels of impacts Weibo discussions have on government legitimacy. More precisely, the discourse in which there is a critique of the current national political system in China is more challenging to government legitimacy than the one in which there are only demands for local changes. The online discourse about the Haimen incident on Weibo even can be seen as reinforcing government legitimacy. Therefore, the impact of online communication on government legitimacy is relative and depends on specific cases. To understand the power of online communication requires us to analyse the nature of online discourses about specific cases and then examine them within external social and political contexts and by comparing them with one another. Contextual dynamics such as social problems and tensions can function as an indicator for understanding the type and level of impact of online communication on government legitimacy.",

    "abstract": "This research explores the specific use of the prominent social media website Twitter during the 2010 Pakistan floods to examine whether users tend to tweet/retweet links from traditional versus social media, what countries these users are tweeting from, and whether there is a correlation between location and the linking of traditional versus social media. The study finds that Western users have an overwhelming preference for linking to traditional media and Pakistani users have a slight preference for linking to social media. The study also concludes that authorities and hubs in our sample have a significant preference for linking to social media rather than traditional media sites. The findings of this study suggest that there is a perceived legitimacy of social media during disasters by users in Pakistan. Additionally, it provides insights into how social media may be – albeit minimally – challenging the dominant position of traditional media in disaster reporting in developing countries.",

    "abstract": "Identification is ever more important in the online world, and identity-related crime is a growing problem related to this. This new category of crime is not restricted to high-profile instances of identity ‘theft’ or identity fraud; it is wide-ranging and complex, ranging from identity deletion to unlawful identity creation and identity ‘theft’. Commonly accepted definitions are lacking, thus blurring available statistics, and policies to combat this new crime are piecemeal at best. To assess the real nature and magnitude of identity-related crime, and to be able to discuss how it can be combated, identity-related crime should be understood in all its aspects. As a first key step, this article introduces a typology of identity-related crime, consisting of conceptual, technical and legal categories, that can be used as a comprehensive framework for future research, countermeasures and policies related to identity-related crime.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to use cultural and technical capital as a sensitizing framework for exploring novel ways of thinking about information and communication technology and social inequalities. This paper takes a particular focus on three weblogs in which women of different ages, social classes, and races constructed discourses on Black womanhood. The participants employed their personal experiences, structural analyses of racism and sexism, media criticism, and aesthetic arguments about Black women's worth, beauty, and value to articulate their vision of Black womanhood. In earlier times, these conversations would have taken place in beauty salons, or other gendered spaces where these conversations could proceed unknown to broader society. In today's information society, these conversations have spilled over to the Internet. It is our contention that this phenomenon – the articulation of cultural capital mediated through technical prowess – is a strong argument against the deficit models of minority information and communication technology use promoted by digital divide research.",

    "abstract": "In this digital age, declarations surface of the death of the expert and the democratization of information. Crowd wisdom is seen as the new guide in constructing and evaluating knowledge. In the context of the art world, this tension between the amateurs and the experts becomes particularly pronounced as popular meets high culture. Questions arise such as: what is the role of the expert in the evaluation of art in contemporary times? Do social media dismantle age-old hierarchies and established priesthoods in the art world? And can we assume that mass participation in valuation results in better judgments? This article addresses such popular notions of participation and expertise concerning social media in the art world through a historical lens by re-examining and positioning art experts from past to present. Particularly, characteristics of intermediaries in the art market are examined closely regarding their strategies in knowledge production and the establishment of expertise. This historical situatedness enables us to move beyond the hype of new media expectations, generating more appropriate avenues of investigation to better grasp possible changes amongst actors within the contemporary art world. This examination is not just theoretically relevant but practically so, given current pressures on art institutions to embrace and reach out to new audiences online.",

    "abstract": "Based on original data from one-on-one and focus group interviews with high school students in California, this article reveals how consistent access to or deprivation from informational resources influences information synthesis for scholastic work. In order to hold motivation constant, the article delineates three kinds of Striver students: Endowed, Entrepreneurial, and Empowered. The article examines the ways in which Strivers obtain information relevant to schoolwork from digital media, non-digital media, and knowledgeable individuals. Findings reveal linkages between access to informational resources and the internalization of a self-reliant or other-reliant stance towards information synthesis. Endowed-Strivers who enjoy synergistic access to informational resources adopt a self-reliant information habitus. By contrast, Entrepreneurial-Strivers with few home resources engage in linear strategies that facilitate an other-reliant information habitus. The third group, the Empowered-Strivers, benefits from school-based interventions that give them multiple information channels. Such IT interventions can act as substitutes for the rich informational resources enjoyed by Endowed-Strivers at home. Access to IT resources and teacher modeling at school make it possible for Empowered-Strivers to develop a self-reliant information habitus with regard to schoolwork. In showing how a favorable school-based information opportunity structure can compensate for inadequate informational resources at home, the analysis reveals the ways in which informational inequality is both created and sometimes overcome. By illuminating the relationships between access conditions, information opportunity structures, and types of information habitus, the article shows how synergistic use of informational resources plays a critical role in larger digital inequalities.",

Scholars have found that new forms of playful, digital civic education can encourage youth civic engagement, and video game theory suggests that the properties of games make them well suited to the problem at hand. This study experimentally tests whether a custom-designed video game simulating the budgetary process can have an effect on political trust, particularly stealth democracy attitudes. Youth who played the game showed a lower level of stealth democracy attitudes than those who did not, but there was no difference in more general trust beliefs. This suggests that games could play a part in youth engagement efforts, but that such efforts are most effective when they are narrowly targeted.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates methodological trends in mobile communication studies. The articles published over the past 20 years in five journals (Communication Research, Journal of Communication, Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, New Media & Society, and Information, Communication & Society) are analysed. The results show that the quantitative and qualitative studies have increased while theoretical accounts have remained few. The quantitative approach is the most applied. The studied articles reflect a structural problem of science communication that stems from the lack of cumulativity of scientific results and cross-national analyses and from the standard length of articles that poses limitations for scientific communication.",

    "title": "The myth of ‘us’: digital networks, political change and the production of collectivity",
    "abstract": "This article examines critically the claims that digital networks (digital media infrastructures, especially social media platforms) fundamentally change the conditions of politics over the longer term. Without doubt digital networks enable faster political mobilization, accelerated cycles of action, and some new forms of collectivity, but how consequential is this in the longer term when set alongside other longer term consequences of a digitally saturated environment? The author argues that some leading accounts of digital media's contributions to political change operate with a thin account of the social, the sort of thin account that historically has been supplemented by media's mythical accounts over the past century of their role in supplying social knowledge. In the digital age, even the most detailed and rigorous accounts of digital networks' contributions to political action (Bennett & Segerberg, 2012, 2013) fail to show that those networks also facilitate longer term political action that builds longer term political transformations: arguably, the resulting acceleration of action encourages short-term loyalties and less stability in political socialization. However, this limitation of existing accounts tends to be masked by a new myth for the age of digital networks: the myth of ‘us’, which encourages us to believe that our gatherings on social media platforms are a natural form of expressive collectivity, even though it is exactly that belief that is at the basis of such platforms' creation of economic value. The article deconstructs that myth, as the starting point for more satisfactory future accounts of digital networks' possible contributions to political change.",

    "title": "MOBILIZING FRIENDS AND STRANGERS",
    "abstract": "What role does the Internet play in mobilizing participants in days of action? Although most research has focused on the way that computer-mediated communication is changing transnational collective action, it is unclear how social movement reliance on this new form of communication is modifying protest within nation-states. This paper analyses how participants in a national day of action in the United States were mobilized, focusing on the role that the Internet played. We find that a very high percentage of participants in all cities heard about the day of action through e-mail lists or websites. Those who mobilized through the Internet, however, were very different from those who mobilized through personal and organizational ties. In particular, the participants who heard about the event through all channels of mediated communication – including the Internet – were much more likely to come to the event alone than those who heard about it through their social networks. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of our findings to collective action and civic participation in the digital age.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This special issue of Information, Communication and Society reflects on the generative work presented at the 2019 annual conference of the Association of Internet Researchers (#AoIR2019). The conference attracted approximately 380 people from 35 countries to work through the theme, Trust in the System. Delegates analysed developments on the internet, in social media and through data management, including those grounded in Indigenous perspectives and varied communities, resiliencies and collective voices. Plenary provocations prompted discussions about our various relationships with “trust”, “system” and “the”, while research sites included webtoons and webnovels, fans and games, chemsex and porn, the rise of digital assistants and evolving digital practices in politics, health, education, environment and the media. Creative industries, automation and platformization figured broadly. Ethics, methods and theory ranged from science and technology studies (STS) to queer and indigenous theory to algorithmic approaches, digital ethnography, creative methods, and emergent work in bot detection across social media. The resulting articles curated for this collection are offered by emerging to established scholars, from around the world.",

    "title": "The Music Industry",
    "abstract": "Recently books on the music industry have inevitably taken a position that is intrinsically negative. The music industry has not had the best press over the last decade, primarily due to the disruption that the internet has brought to their door. That is why it was particularly refreshing to read Wilkström’s The Music Industry, which provides an objective overview of the industry in its current form. Instead of focusing on a singular issue or providing a politically charged rally against cultural domination by ‘evil media’, Wilkström provides a comprehensive descriptive overview of the entire industry, covering not only the recording studios, but also publishers, licensing and live performance promotion, and the issues that face them today. These issues include: the music industry’s increasing role as a copyright industry; how the industry is organized and how its various branches interact; how digitalization has impacted business practices and models; how music is made within the industry structure; the processes of producing a branded artist; the role of creative fans and amateurs. Throughout the book is an occasional reference to music being ‘in the cloud’, a description of which is given at the beginning of the book. This concept of the cloud is how Wilkström describes what he perceives to be the shift of music from physical media to it existing in the network of connected computational devices. Although useful within the introduction, the concept seems like an after-thought and although is perhaps present as a background driver of the changes in the industry, never seems to be prominent in the rest of the text. Overall, the book acts as a primer to the larger issues surrounding information technology’s integration into the sphere of music commerce. It touches on all the issues but does not provide much more than a nod of recognition to them, happy to leave the depths to be plumbed by the myriad of more specialized single-issue texts out there. However, the book’s strength is precisely in its introductory nature and that it is pitched perfectly to a reader who simply wants to know about the contemporary industry. Many will find the chapter on the structuring of the overall industry particularly useful, as it provides organizational diagrams which aid as a quick reference for how music is produced and distributed as",

    "abstract": "Drotner and Livingstone’s attempt to bring media into childhood studies in order to shed light into the long neglected and forgotten link between children and media is one that engages both the contributors and potential readers to many aspects of sociology of childhood and media studies. The International Handbook of Children, Media and Culture fulfils the expectation of those familiar with the literature around children and media through incorporating aspects that have been overlooked before. It comes at a time when scholars both in the field of sociology of childhood and media studies have been looking for a merging point between the two fields that not only takes full account of critical theories of media and communication but also encompasses an account of childhood studies from a sociological perspective rather than a clinical developmental psychology point of view. The book offers a wide range of perspectives within the sociology of childhood and is a must read for anyone who is interested in childhood. Also those who are interested in media literacy, consumerism, cultural studies and critique of media would find the book extremely useful in terms of its inclusion of children and the youth as active members of the audience. Due to its multi-disciplinary nature, the book would be of interest to scholars and students from across the social sciences and studies regardless of their prior knowledge of the fields. The editors’ introductions to each part not only link the running themes of the book but also work towards providing the readers who might be unfamiliar to the field with an understating of the themes and discussions. In addition, some of the chapters by key authors in their fields such as Prout, Lemish and Buckingham also provide a comprehensive cover of the literature while familiarizing the reader with the traditional and current discussions on their topics and also introduce the reader to the essential theoretical underpinnings. The collection of essays put together by Drotner and Livingstone in this volume are presented in a thematic order in which the reader can find informative and analytical background literature into childhood studies and media’s take on children in the first part. The following parts each provide insightful essays on",

    "abstract": "This article examines entrepreneurs who have started innovative Internet and mobile technology companies in Taiwan because they are at the forefront of industrial changes in the country. Similar to findings in Europe and the USA, education and careers in technology in Taiwan remain dominated by men. However, I argue that the gender inequality of the sector is partly the result of the fact that small new enterprises rely on family support and close social networks. Few women are able to join the sector with male friends and colleagues due to the close social ties of the founding teams (homophily). Among my female interviewees, half have started their nascent companies with their husbands and male partners (husband and wife teams). However, gender, family backgrounds and childcare responsibilities affect both men and women, and the interviewees in my study were open in discussing these personal factors in relation to being entrepreneurs. This article argues that starting an Internet company is a family decision, discussed within the household. Intersectionality, not only gender, explains the founders’ decision to start a company, and their choice of co-founders.",

    "abstract": "Serious games like PeaceMaker are emerging as a new medium for peace education (PE). We focus on the assessment of this computerized simulation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in order to identify the effects it might have in helping to narrow the knowledge gap between the players. In addition, we examine the role of news media use about the conflict in knowledge acquisition after playing the game. We conducted an experimental study with the participation of 185 Israeli undergraduate students of Jewish and Palestinian origin. In order to gauge the effect of the game with regard to knowledge acquisition about the conflict, we used a pre- and post-intervention experimental design and utilized questionnaires. We found that the knowledge gap between participants who held high levels of knowledge about the conflict and those who held low levels of knowledge about it before playing the game narrowed after playing it. Second, participants holding more knowledge about the conflict before playing the game were more likely to win it than those holding less knowledge. Finally, the game narrowed the knowledge gap between participants who consumed television (TV) as a major source of information about the conflict and those who did not consume it. Our results indicate that serious games like PeaceMaker are effective as a tool for PE, because they are useful in increasing knowledge about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and narrowing the knowledge gap between the players, particularly for young people who are direct parties to this conflict and native to the online world.",

    "abstract": "Drawing on community expertise, open-source software and non-hierarchical organizational strategies, community wireless networks (CWN) engage volunteers in building networks for public internet access and community media. Volunteers intend these networks to be used to reinvigorate local community. Together the following two purposes create two distinct mediated publics: to engage volunteers in discussing and undertaking technical innovations, and to provide internet access and local community media to urban citizens. To better address the potential of CWN as a form of local innovation and democratic rationalization, the relationship between the two publics must be better understood. Using a case study of a Canadian CWN, this article advances the category of ‘public’ as alternative and complementary to ‘community’ as it is used to describe the social and technical structures of these projects. By addressing the tensions between the geek-public of WiFi developers, and the community-public of local people using community WiFi networks, this article revisits questions about the democratic impact of community networking projects. The article concludes that CWN projects create new potential for local community engagement, but that they also have a tendency to reinforce geek-publics more than community-publics, challenging the assumption that community networks using technology development as a vector for social action necessarily promote greater democracy.",

    "abstract": "Decline in the size and diversity of American's core networks has been tied to the displacement of face-to-face interaction and to lower societal well-being. Comparing core networks in the United States, Norway, and Ukraine, we reject the conclusions that frequent in-person contact predicts individual well-being and that large/diverse networks predict broader societal well-being. Individuals of lower socioeconomic status (SES) and societies with lower levels of overall prosperity have higher rates of in-person contact. Internet use is associated with higher in-person contact for the socioeconomically advantaged but lower rates of in-person contact for the disadvantaged. In-person and ICT-based contact is generally associated with maintaining a larger network, but in societies of lower well-being frequent interaction impedes the ability to maintain a large network. In contrast to the positive relationship between individual SES and network size, societal prosperity has a negative relationship to network size. Findings are discussed in relation to social support, democratic engagement, and the digital divide.",

    "title": "INFORMATION, CAPITALISM AND UNCERTAINTY",
    "abstract": "This article argues that the changes characterized by many commentators as announcing the ‘information age’ are better seen, not as heralding a new type of society, but as the continuation, consolidation and extension of capitalism – something which is accompanied by constant upheaval and innovation. The shift from conceiving the ‘information society’ as a result of technological breakthroughs to one which lays emphasis on the primacy of ‘information’ itself is observed. The importance especially of informational labour’s ‘flexibility’ is regarded, not as indicative of a new age but of the requirements of globalized capitalism which engenders change the better to consolidate its practices. The instability of life today is ascribed, not to the upheavals resulting from the ‘information revolution’, but rather to the insatiable dynamic that has long been a distinguishing feature of capitalist enterprise. These processes are examined in terms of the shift from public to private provision of information and in the heightened uncertainty of existence today.",

    "title": "NEW MEDIA'S POTENTIAL FOR PERSONALIZATION",
    "abstract": "Despite the growing maturity of new, interactive media, rhetoric about its possibilities and potentialities that abounded in its earliest days still endures. The growth of detailed and empirical work, which has sought to populate the digital landscape with grounded research calling into question this rhetoric, has not stopped new media debate from continuing to be shaped, in part, by the language of the potential. This paper is concerned with one aspect of new media's potential, personalization. It focuses on new media's proclaimed capacity to be adapted to meet the needs and desires of individual users. This is a trope that runs through much humanities and social sciences literature on new media and ICTs, yet despite recognition of the possibility of personalization offered by networked media technologies, there is very little grounded, empirical work on this subject in these fields. In order to address this absence, this paper compares an attempt to personalize new media web content on a two-year research endeavour entitled Project @pple with the rhetoric about the potentiality for personalization that new technologies offers. It aims to contribute to understandings of personalization by detailing the issues that arise when attempting to implement it. The argument of the paper is that the difficulties encountered on Project @pple suggest that, in real-life situations, characterized as they are by constraints and complexities, it is not always a straightforward process for personalization to cease to be potential and to become actual.",

    "abstract": "At a time when children and young people are regarded as being disenchanted with participating in civil and political affairs, and given their perceived enthusiasm for information and communication technologies (ICTs), it is small wonder that some regard the Internet as a promising conduit with which to re-engage teenagers. This issue of iCS opens with a robust empirical analysis by Sonia Livingstone, Magdalena Bober and Ellen Helsper of the factors influencing Internet-mediated participation by young people and children. Drawing on the findings of the UK Children Go Online project the article reports that activities which may be seen to constitute participation on the Internet are indeed widely undertaken by young people. As one might expect, however, such participatory online activities are not uniform across the social spectrum. Livingstone and her colleagues suggest that three principle groups – interactors, the civic-minded and the disengaged – represent quite distinct approaches to adoption of the Internet. Moreover, visits to websites designed for civil use were significantly influenced by social class factors. The article concludes with some observations for how the design of civic websites could be improved to attract and retain the interest of young people. The use of ICTs as a means to ‘re-invent’ (Osborne & Gaebler 1992; Heeks 1999), or more recently to ‘modernize’ public services in many economically advanced nation-states, has and continues to be a major area of policy activity. The e-government mission is heralded around the world as a technologically driven opportunity to provide better governance in a more costeffective and electorally acceptable manner. Our second article in this issue of iCS undertakes a comparative analysis in an attempt to identify the principle factors shaping the adoption of ICTs to reform welfare states. The findings come from expert informants from 13 OECD countries and focus upon the respective aims of the computerization of social security systems over a 15-year period. Four hypotheses are utilized as a means of elucidating the key drivers. The first three, relating to the social constructivist accounts of technological change, attribute varying policy objectives to different welfare regimes, forms of capitalism and/or types of public administration. The fourth hypothesis suggests that expectations of operational efficiency and expenditure savings are the main driving force for computerizing social security systems. Over the 13 countries examined the authors argue that the final hypothesis, which plays down the significance of social factors,",

    "abstract": "Importantly, for me, this book’s editors discuss the wide-ranging nature of the ‘problem’ of creating an online program, with articulation of the transdisciplinary approach used in addressing the problem and compiling the book (see p. xiv). This establishes strong potential for the usefulness of the book to other practitioners grappling with the challenge. I approached my doctoral thesis in the same way, incorporating disparate theoretical perspectives from education, sociology, business, design and so on. Gibbons et al. (1994) are the first proponents of ‘Mode 2’ knowledge including such a transdisciplinary approach – the context of application is the focus for solving a problem, drawing on knowledge and experience not necessarily from the prevailing disciplinary map. Solomon & Usher (1998) also point out that what constitutes ‘valid’ research is not only based on a traditional scientific enquiry. The Mode 2 approach is clearly evident in both the research and practice cited in the book under review. This is a refreshing change and highly commendable in my opinion. However, I feel the book falls short in that there is incomplete interrogation of the interdisciplinary opinion presented – missing are connections to consolidate key points, and a strong final section is needed to draw the threads together and make sense of what it all means. Naturally readers will bring their own knowledge and experience to the reading and interpretation, but I was left feeling the book had not gone far enough and was at risk of being an eclectic exposition rather than a cohesive whole (albeit with chapters arranged in four clusters). This does not necessarily realize the full potential of the book for extending the body of knowledge. The book gives an excellent picture of LEEP and this is very informative, especially for more recent ‘players’ or those planning online programs. This is helpful for identifying possible application of the learning to other contexts and situations. However, I believe it does not go far enough and it has a sense of ‘cobbling together’ separate papers. A simple technique to address this is to have shaded boxes at the end of each paper to capture the main learning outcomes. This could be consolidated further at the end of each of the four clusters of papers, or the editors could introduce the central themes at the",

    "title": "IN THEIR OWN IMAGE?",
    "abstract": "This article relies on in-depth qualitative interviews with 21 web designers, active in the fields of Catholicism, Protestantism and holistic spirituality in the Netherlands, to study religious appropriations of the Internet. The authors found that these different religious groups embraced the medium of the Internet motivated by a common desire to make oneself heard in the cacophony of voices that has resulted from processes of secularization and religious change. In doing so, Catholic web designers struggle with the dilemma of either following Roman orthodoxy or creating room for dialogue and diversity, whereas their Protestant counterparts feel forced to either let a thousand flowers bloom or surrender to a highly compromised image of their faith. Holistic spirituality, finally, struggles with neither of these problems and appropriates the Internet as its virtually natural habitat for sharing and connecting. The authors conclude that, consistent with theories about cultured technology and spiritualizing of the Internet, offline religious heritages matter a lot when religions seek to appropriate the Internet through web design. These appropriations tend not to be smooth transpositions of coherent and conflict-free offline religious heritages to online environments, however, but conflict-ridden processes stirring long-standing struggles over authority and identity.",

    "title": "A river by any other name: Ganga/Ganges and the postcolonial politics of knowledge on Wikipedia",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The historically established relationship between knowledge and power has enabled critical scholars across disciplines to interrogate the ways in which knowledge has served as the handmaiden of various forms of power. The ways in which that relationship operates in the digital realm however remains to be fully understood. This essay’s analysis of an edit war that occurred over the naming of the Wikipedia page on the Indian river Ganga, seeks to understand the operation of that relationship in the networked digital realm. Through analyzing the conflict and evaluating the different arguments proffered by the opposing sides in the debate, this essay attempts to uncover the contradictions within its desired goal of apolitical and neutral knowledge that Wikipedia is founded upon. The analysis shows that debates on Wikipedia are invariably imbued with pre-existing entrenched ideologies thus ensuring that persistence and numerical strength outweigh evidence and the merit of an argument as determining factors. This holds crucial lessons for the imaginations of a plural and globally representative web that was supposed to challenge the inequities of the offline world.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Government-based and corporate-based surveillance have regularly been accused of violating personal privacy, an elemental right in a democratic society. In this comparative study, we examine how the institutional actor behind the privacy violation affects discourse surrounding the violations. Looking at newspaper and blog coverage surrounding two similar invasions of privacy – the NSA espionage programs that Edward Snowden brought to light alongside Verizon and other corporations’ use of a tracking code called a supercookie – we show key differences in the how media reactions to the topic are discursively constructed. Our findings show more moral polarization surrounding the characterization of the NSA and the perceived threat of their actions compared to media coverage on supercookies. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how neoliberal techniques of governance shift social perceptions of institutional actors and the potential harm they might produce in society.",

    "title": "Digital divergence: analysing strategy, interpretation and controversy in the case of the introduction of an ebook reader technology",
    "abstract": "What happens when a media innovation encounters the marketplace in the form of critical bloggers and commentators? This paper adapts conceptual frameworks from science and technology studies – particularly actor-network theory (ANT) and social construction of technology (SCOT) – in order to analyse the process of introducing new media devices and the role of users and mediators in this process, by way of an empirically based study on digital strategy and marketing by a traditional book industry actor. The case studied is the Kibano Digireader, introduced to the Norwegian book market in 2011 and immediately heavily criticized. Looking into the role of tech bloggers and social media pundits, the paper argues that the success of consumer technologies relies upon an alignment with particular social groups, and their perceptions of relevance and demand. I further argue that the specific insights gained on book industry digitalization are applicable across other media industries and aim at a theoretical contribution by discussing and applying ANT/SCOT concepts on new media development. Based on analyses of press coverage and social media commentaries from November 2011, the paper addresses the following questions: What were the perceived demands and problems intended to be solved by the Digireader? How did the controversy over the Digireader play out and what arguments were raised against and in favour of the device? How can the social media commentators be categorized in terms of their engagement with and interpretation of the Digireader?",

    "title": "INTRODUCTION",
    "abstract": "‘e-Social Science’ refers to a new generation of digital and computational tools and methods for conducting social science research. As a label, it will no doubt become obsolete, the ‘e-’ will be dropped and these tools and methods will be as little noticed as the everyday use of computers now is. While the label is still with us, however, it helps to highlight issues that are arising with the increasing use of these tools and methods, and make the most of a window of time to attempt to tackle them, while they remain novel. The most pressing issues relate to the legal and ethical aspects of data in digital form and the computational processing of data. This is the focus of the current special issue. ‘e-Science’ generally was associated with the establishment of grid computing as a resource for facilitating computationally expensive research in the natural sciences, but since the late 1990s when the grid began to emerge as a new technology for science, here have been two important changes. First, cloud computing has emerged as a viable alternative to grid computing. Secondly, a panoply of digital and computational methods has been developed in social and human sciences. Qualitative methods in social research are now as digital as in any other field, since data in text, audio and video form are now overwhelmingly gathered and stored, using digital means. Increasingly, computational methods are being used for the analysis and interpretation of qualitative and quantitative data. Extensive data archives and repositories, accessed via the Internet, are facilitating data reuse to an extent that was unimaginable even a decade ago and enormous volumes of new data are generated continuously in an environment of ubiquitous and pervasive computing. In addition, social researchers are turning their attention to the analysis of social behaviour which is mediated or made possible by the Internet, possibly the most ubiquitous presence of information technology in our daily lives. Social media such as Facebook and Twitter provide fascinating new ways of accessing information about social behaviour. Finally, all of these modes of obtaining data necessitate new modes of analysis and",

The diversity of approaches to the various facets and concerns raised by the collective action of aggrieved groups the world over impresses through multidisciplinarity and the wealth of insights it has generated. This introduction to a special issue of the international journal Information, Communication and Society is an invitation to recover conceptual instruments – such as the ecological trope – that have fallen out of fashion in media and communication studies. We account for their fall from grace and explicate the rationale for seeking to reinsert them into the empirical terrain of interlocking media, communication practices and protest which we aim to both capture with theory and adopt as a starting point for further analytical innovation.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper articulates the emergence of the user-citizen as a result of techno-solutionist approaches to pandemic management by tracing the rapid infrastructuralisation of surveillance in and through the platformisation of pandemic governance in Vietnam. Coinciding with Vietnam’s rollout of chip-based national identification cards for citizens over the age of 14, the development of a one-stop ‘super-app’ solution that streamlines data flows across different domains of authority happened in a context where platforms were increasingly discussed alongside, and understood on the same terms as, infrastructure. By conducting situational analysis of publicly available policy documents and official government communication, the paper traces how pandemic platforms contract and expand in response to evolving pandemic management needs, and gives an account of the evolution of institutional dependency across different domains of authority and technology development. Using Vietnam as a case study, this paper contributes to ongoing theorisation at the intersection of platformisation and infrastructuralisation in pandemic social service provision. The paper is an invitation to examine the increasing entanglements of technology and citizenship performances around the world as they unfold throughout the course of the pandemic and beyond.",

    "abstract": "This article applies instruments of social network analysis to a study of communication networks within the Italian and German extremist right. Web links between organizational websites are used as a proxy. Indeed, extremist groups increasingly use and abuse the Internet for their propaganda and their recruitment, and also for their internal communication. The analysis includes both political parties and non-party organizations, even violent groups. In a macro-, micro-, and meso-analysis, the various specificities of the two national political sectors are demonstrated and linked to the offline reality. The Italian network appears to be very fragmented, highly diversified, and difficult to be coordinated (‘policephalous network’), whereas the German network is denser and much more concentrated on a few central actors (‘star structure’). These differences are mainly due to political opportunity structures in the two countries. Additionally, whereas the Italian network structure allows for the construction of a typology of sub-groups of organizations, the German communicative structure seems to be more erratic and less coordinated. The article also highlights the function of websites which are not related to any specific group. Indeed, these are of special importance for the far right as a political arena which is usually banned from the dominant societal discourses (if not even legally forbidden). Considering this, new modes of communication can be of greater use for extremist groups than for more traditional political actors.",

Owing to the youthful suppleness of their bodies, children’s fingerprints are more likely to succeed in fulfilling biometric requirements. They are also more compliant in having their schooling or playtime disrupted by the unpredictable and time-consuming biometric authentication process. Children’s names may also be added on ration cards to facilitate food security for relatives other than their parents who depend on the biometric viability of children’s bodies and time for welfare. Supplementing ethnographic data with the state’s data of the biometric authentications recorded in the Aadhaar database of India, I make visible the poor child as an ‘ideal biometric child’ in enabling the biometric assemblage of the welfare state to care for its citizens.",

Governments, notably in the USA and Europe, have taken action to shape and smooth this transition in response to the desire of business to exploit a new commercial opportunity. A series of measures has been enacted in relatively new international fora whose general aim is to promote the development of international production and trade. There is evidence of concerted efforts aimed at designing an interconnected regulatory framework within which global electronic commerce might evolve. Governmental interests have attempted to promote the ethos of a new liberalized, self-regulatory system that prioritizes commercial and trademark interests of business.",

    "title": "Neoliberal gremlins? How a scheme to help disadvantaged young people thrive online fell short of its ambitions",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Numerous academic studies highlight the significant differences in the ways that young people access, use and engage with the Internet and the implications it has in their lives. Trying to address such inequalities is complex, and the outcomes of digital inclusion schemes are rarely uniformly positive or transformative for the people involved. Therefore the hope of such schemes that if sufficiently empowered, incentivised and aspirational, the disadvantaged can use access to technology to transform or transcend what Bourdieu [1992. The logic of practice. Studies in philosophy and education. Cambridge: Polity Press; New Ed edition] calls their ‘class of conditions’ (p. 53) is largely misplaced. This gap between expectation and reality demands theoretical attention. Focusing on a two-year digital inclusion scheme for 30 teenagers and their families in one area of England, this qualitative study analyses why, despite the good intentions of the scheme’s stakeholders, it fell short of its ambitions. Instead, our theoretical analysis explains how the neoliberalist systems of governance that are increasingly shaping the cultures and behaviours of our Internet service providers and schools cannot solve the problems they create.",

    "title": "Imaginative play in digital environments: designing social and creative opportunities for identity formation",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Digital technologies afford ample opportunities for children’s development, identity formation, imagination and sociability through free play. At stake, we argue, is children’s agency. Yet free play is under threat in both digital and nondigital contexts. Recognising that different configurations of the contexts in which play occurs affect whether and how children can play on their own terms, this article draws on the long tradition of research on child-led or free play in natural or nondigital contexts to explore children’s play in digital contexts. Combining qualitative and quantitative research methods, we examine the qualities of children’s play and the factors that shape it so as to reimagine, together with children, parents and professionals working with children, a digital environment that could better serve children’s best interests. The findings show that the qualities of children’s play are strikingly similar in digital and nondigital contexts but that children find certain social-technical configurations restrictive of their agency and freedom to develop their identity through play in digital contexts. Based on children’s implicit and explicit calls for change, we propose a ‘playful by design’ approach by which designers and providers of digital products and services could urge those with the powers to redesign digital environments to prioritise digital features that promote children’s imaginative, social, open-ended, risk-taking and stimulating play while limiting the risks to children’s safety, privacy and self-determination that arise from commercial interests.",

    "abstract": "With the development and widespread use of the Internet, more and more people make friends online. Such friendship can shift to other settings. For example, many online friends also meet each other face-to-face. Therefore, online friendship can be performed in different social spaces. The relationship between online friendship and the social spaces where it is performed has rarely been discussed. Based on a study of seafarer-partners’ friendships formed on a discussion website, this paper demarcates friendship performed in three different spaces: the website itself, another online setting, and offline space. It suggests that the more spaces the friendship expands into, the more intimate and rewarding it becomes. This paper also explores the implications of each setting for maintaining performing friendship.",

    "title": "Investigating the cause and effect factors of young children’s smartphone overuse: focusing on the influence of parenting factors",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This research investigates the causal factors of smartphone overuse in young children, especially toddlers and preschoolers aged 1–6 years, including parenting style, efficacy, and stress, and parents’ smartphone overuse and the effect on children’ temperaments. Data were collected through a web-based survey in South Korea. Participants were smartphone users who had a child using a smartphone under six years. There were 357 responses in the sample. Roughly 80.4% of parents were in their 30s, and 46.5% of children were toddlers aged 1–3 years. We used structural equation modeling to investigate the relation between children’s smartphone overuse and parenting-related variables. Parenting style influences parenting efficacy, which decreases parenting stress and smartphone overuse among both parents and children. Parents’ smartphone overuse also influences children’s smartphone overuse. Young children’s smartphone overuse affects their activity, emotional sensitivity, and sociability. Finally, smartphone overuse and emotional sensitivity are higher in toddlers than preschoolers. Our results provide practical implications for the parents, government, and providers of content for young children. First, parents should delay their young children’s smart devices usage, watch together, and communicate when their young children use smart devices. Second, government should provide timely information about parenting. Finally, content providers should make content shorter and provide warnings to take breaks, and develop content that improves children’s activity and sociability, and tailoring content to particular age groups.",

Using a combined model of Diffusion of Innovation theory and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), N-Screen acceptance was empirically investigated based on usability and diffusion factors. The results show that the diffusion factors of N-Screen significantly influence the usability, which subsequently affects adoption of the technology. The policy and managerial implications of the model for N-Screen are discussed. This study ultimately provides an in-depth analysis and heuristic data on consumer drivers, market dynamics, and policy implications within the N-Screen ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The far right is notoriously effective in its use of digital media to mobilize people and to build a sense of collective identity around oppositional cultures. Yet, while research has begun to explore far-right groups’ social media hyperlinking activities, relatively little is known about the purposes and communicative functions of this form of communication. By combining social network analysis and qualitative content analysis on Facebook data obtained from 17 PEGIDA and Generation Identity Facebook pages in the period around the so-called ‘refugee crisis’ (2015–2017), this exploratory study investigates the linked source types and their purposes. We find that the groups predominantly link to mainstream media, far-right media and far-right non-institutional groups. While there are great overlaps in the communicative functions and purposes of the links for the two networks, the PEGIDA groups mainly focus on the promotion of political issues, especially around the opposition to third-country (Muslim) immigration, while the GI groups use them for self-promotional purposes. These differences are largely explainable by the groups’ adverse (online) mobilization aims.",

    "abstract": "This paper reports on an exploratory study of how executives in organizations perceive the entrance of the ‘net generation’ into the workplace. We approached this question by collecting data from interviews, focus groups, and an online survey. The results show that executives perceive tensions associated with values and behaviors of the net generation workers as the younger workers enter current organizational settings as well as technology-related issues not solely associated with the younger generation. The paper discusses the different organizational mechanisms and strategies executives use to address these tensions. Particularly, we discuss executives’ preference for top-down strategies and their tendency to address the triad of technology–values–behavior as separate components instead of a unified concept.",

The relationship between caring and various forms of capital has scarcely been noticed by social scientists, either theoretically or empirically. After reviewing the concepts of caring and capital, 77 websites related to caring capital were analyzed to explore these types of questions: How large, influential and effective is the care-oriented sector of the web? How is it best to categorize the diversity of websites promoting caring capital? What social or interactive and user-generated opportunities are offered by these web sites? What implications for the future do these web organizations have? While we cannot offer any definitive answer to the question of the potential of the Internet for facilitating caring capital, this study's glimpse of the web finds only minimal charitable activity compared to the huge need for greater compassionate caring at both individual and organizational levels.",

    "title": "Charm offensive: mediatized country image transformations in international relations",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper focuses on what has come to be known as a ‘charm offensive,’ a diplomatic technique countries may use to shift their international image through strategic public relations campaigns utilizing personal magnetism. The charm of the selected representative is meant to appeal to a broad international audience with the hope of improving the country's brand. The paper examines the concept and practice of a charm offensive through two case studies. The first is the Iranian charm offensive during the 2015 negotiations of the nuclear deal with the United States, when Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mohammad Javad Zarif aimed to improve his country's controversial international image through gentle, diplomatic communication and an aura of civility. The second case study is the charm offensive of North Korea from the 2018 Winter Olympics until the historic meeting of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald J. Trump in June 2018. Both case studies analyze the media representations of the particular charm offensive in two countries, the United States and a regionally more proximate, and therefore likely more directly affected country: Israel and South Korea, respectively. I argue that quick image-transformations often characterize contemporary, highly mediatized international diplomatic communication. Unlike classical cases of soft power, the temporary alliances forged through charm offensives are not built on shared values, but on momentary appearances, and sometimes on deception.",

    "title": "SRSLY?? A typology of online ironic markers",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Social media constitute a fertile though challenging arena for the use of ironic humor. A combination of facilitating and hindering factors turns the production and identification of irony in this sphere into a complex venture, positioning it as a powerful tool in consolidating group boundaries. The main aims of this paper are to identify the markers of ironic humor on social media and to explicate their workings within the dynamics of digital interactions. Existing literature about ironic markers addresses mostly face-to-face and mass-mediated interactions, while there is a gap in our understanding of the production and interpretation of irony in the unique communicative conditions of social media. An analysis of a bilingual corpus of successful and failed ironic utterances extracted from five social network sites yielded a novel typology of five ironic markers: platform, participants, style, intra-textual content, and contextual knowledge. These markers both resemble and deviate from features of irony in non-digital settings. Media affordances often allow access to necessary complementary information, yet such forensic activity is only accessible to active users, who recognize the need for further investigation of the meant. Hence, using certain types of ironic markers forms utterances that are decipherable to some audiences but opaque to others. In this sense, the marking of digital irony and its decoding both rely on group boundaries and play a central role in their delineation. We conclude by evaluating the roles of this new regime of ironic markers in processes of boundary work.",

    "abstract": "This article examines two components of temporality that have implications for electronically mediated communication. One is the dichotomy of simultaneous/non-simultaneous communication and then the varying degrees of non-simultaneity that are possible. The other is the fundamental difference between timed and untimed communication. Timed communication is temporally based and sequential, while untimed communication, such as print and still image content, is spatially based. The article argues that there are two fundamental types of mediated communication: communication mediated across time and communication mediated across space. The implications of temporality for both forms of mediated communication are examined in detail. The implications of temporality and mediated communication for multimedia, technology convergence, and research are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the global information society, individual privacy is seriously endangered. An increasing amount of personal data is being transferred around the world, and communication data of users could be easily traced and used to create individual communication using new information infrastructures. With contemporary network technologies, it is difficult to protect personal data adequately. The Internet, as an important contemporary information highway, is missing essential features of reliability, functionality, confidentiality and integrity, and is threatened by various security attacks. This paper discusses privacy and security risks in the global information society. It also compares and critically analyses the approaches to privacy protection of different information infrastructure programmes. The difficulties for a common harmonised legal approach to privacy protection, due to cultural differences, are analysed. Finally, possibilities for designing information infrastructures adequate under social...",

    "title": "ON THE NATURE OF FUTURE WORLDS? - CONSIDERATIONS OF VIRTUALITY AND UTOPIAS",
    "abstract": "It has been a widespread belief that computers can create viable utopias, design the future and plan and co-ordinate things such that the world can be born anew. The exponential increase in computing power has allowed for interaction in imaginary places – utopian spaces – and the endless re-configuration of those places. There are then good reasons to make links between the realm of the virtual and the creation of utopian and future worlds. We explore some of these links in this article. Having offered a preliminary discussion of the nature of traditional utopian and future world thinking, we then draw a distinction between stable state and flexible utopias, the former characterized by structurally fixed blueprints, the latter by the possibilities of virtual technologies which allow us endlessly to re-configure virtual spaces. This distinction leads us on to a debate that is implicit in the writings of Sherry Turkle and Richard Coyne, namely the analysis of the virtual from a Husserlian, as opposed to the dominant Heideggerian view. We defend a Husserlian analysis which, it is shown, better satisfies the concept of ‘flexible utopias’. The totalizing existential experience by a Heideggerian analysis corresponds well to ‘immersion’ technologies e.g. games and VR, utopias as ready-mades but, a Husserlian approach allows us to account for the creative process of making utopian or future worlds using software such as interior design when one changes items ad infinitum as part of the normal practices of being a designer. In the conclusion we will pull together the strands of the article and, end by noting how the contemporary theorist, Robert Nozick complements our arguments when he offers a version of utopia as a meta-utopia of flexible utopias or future worlds!",

    "title": "Putting the critique back into a<i>Critique of Information</i>: refusing to follow the order",
    "abstract": "This paper argues that Scott Lash's Critique of Information is one of the most important works of the new informational order: the Order. However, despite its comprehensive and insightful analysis, it illustrates a common trend amongst theorists whereby the inherent pessimism of their arguments' logic tends to be replaced by an unwarranted optimism regarding their conclusions. This criticism is applied to Lash's critique, which is further supplemented by a rejection of Lash's argument that the transcendent perspective necessary for critical theory has been supplanted in the information age by an immanent all-at-onceness. The much more negative perceptions of the social and cultural effects of the Order to be found within literature and cultural history are defended as valuable sources of critical perspectives that may still help to aid theory as it struggles to keep up with the Order's discombobulating flows.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This research-based essay presents evidence concerning the leading dimensions that make an empirical communication research article interesting. Based on a survey to editorial boards (EBs) of 16 communication journals, five different categories of interest were found: counterintuitive, foundational, new approach, quality and exemplarity, and insightful and practical. By outlining these categories, the article provides illustrative examples of interesting studies, aiming to stimulate the research community to better assess the potentiality of their contributions, and thus elevating the likelihood of being influential and appealing. To contextualize these findings, the study also provides evidence from EBs regarding the research system itself, arguing that there is a gap between the current robustness of empirical developments and the apathy about them showed by some field’s forefathers. The article finally reflects on the social division of academics based on the research nature of their studies, suggesting that the ‘empirical’ term has lost its original meaning of evidenced-based research and became shorthand for most quantitative work, made by ‘social scientists’.",

    "abstract": "We reflect on the experiences of OLDES (Older People@Home), a European Commission 6th Framework-co-funded project, which sought to undertake a user-centred design of telecare services for older people. A series of interventions were undertaken with the objective of nurturing co-production. The aim was a rebalancing of the techno-centric focus of the system development and delivery partners in the project in order to address the wider needs and interests of other members and stakeholders (in particular, health, social care and the voluntary/community sector) as well as those of the older people themselves and their carers. The intention, in response to the challenges posed by an ageing demographic, was to effect wider discussions about the role of a telecare in the sustainable development of health and social care services. We use this experience to reflect on the practical struggles involved in trying to build a shared set of understandings and practices that might enable a variant of co-production to be nurtured and to evolve. We conclude by discussing the challenges of being engaged in this sort of process and the need to include spaces and occasions for the innovation of inter-organisational relationships as an essential part of the shaping of complex products and services of this type.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Research into office automation originally acted as a catalyst for research into gender perspectives on information technology. Whilst a fuller picture of women's use of ICTs is emerging, there has been little research on women's leisure use of ICTs, particularly within a domestic setting. Added to the way in which the leisure studies discipline has discovered gender as a variable, this is somewhat surprising. In this paper we argue that current debates on ‘virtual culture’ would be enriched by analysing the gender dimensions of the use of ICTs for leisure. In addressing personal agency we see women as active agents rather than passive victims of existing structures. The paper addresses negotiations around leisure and the use of technology in the home and how this illuminates the construction of gender identities. The ways in which work and leisure seep into one another are examined through a consideration of electronic mail and the World Wide Web. Although we conclude that women's leisure access...",

    "title": "Can World System Theory predict news flow on twitter? The case of government-sponsored broadcasting",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Social media platforms provide world governments with the opportunity to distribute news content from their broadcast channels directly to foreign publics [Wallerstein, I. (1974). The modern world system. New York: Academic Press] World System Theory, which has successfully explained and predicted the structure of international news flow, is now being challenged. Specifically, these social platforms undermined assumptions regarding the one-way flow of information toward audiences and the exclusive institutional nature of the players in the international system. This study examines the unique case of government-sponsored news media and its international news flow. It finds that while the structure of the international news flow on Twitter exhibits a hierarchical core–periphery structure, non-institutional actors (e.g. bloggers) conformed less than institutional players (e.g. governments and news media) to that structure. This study also found that non-institutional actors assumed the role of bridging news sources and audiences, a role traditionally reserved for a small minority of elite news media. The growing and diversified pool of information mediators resulted in a more fragmented network of news flow, siloed, rather than interconnected. Research findings are synthesized and analyzed in the context of international broadcasting and social media scholarship.",

    "abstract": "Sociodemographic variables are held to impact Internet users’ willingness and ability to productively use online media. This effect can create a ‘participation divide’ between distinct user groups. Recently, studies have enhanced our understanding of the participation divide by differentiating types of online content creation. They found that sociodemographics may only affect specific forms of online participation. We suggest that social cognitive theory (SCT) helps explain why and how sociodemographic variables influence different forms of online participation. Based on SCT, we analyze the mediating effect of two cognitive constructs, self-efficacy and privacy concerns, on different types of online content creation. We conduct a survey among German Internet users and apply structural equation modeling to compare three distinct theoretical models. We find that considering the mediating effects of cognitive constructs, based on SCT, improves our understanding of which sociodemographic variables affect which type of online content creation – and why.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT With the emergence of such videos addressing Tourette syndrome on YouTube, in which affected persons present themselves, Tourette experts observe an increasing number of patients showing Tourette-like symptoms. Interviews show that they are not only familiar with these videos but have also dealt with them in different ways. Medical analyses combined with the evaluations of the interviews give reason to believe that the videos can be interpreted as triggers for certain groups of people. The evaluation of the data on the media use of the patients traces their subjective use of social media as well as their opinions on central content to get insight on how the use of the videos in question is integrated into their media activities. It becomes apparent that the trigger function of the videos cannot be explained by a consistent mode of reception. Further contextual variables must be taken into account to understand the phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "This paper reports on a two-day workshop held in Sweden (7–8 April 2008) to bring together researchers and professionals to share insights and experiences in the application of information and communication technology (ICT) to sustainable development (SD). The third in a series of events sponsored by the Swedish Program for Information and Communication Technology in Developing Regions (SPIDER), this workshop was aimed at fostering experience sharing among participants, creation of opportunities for formulating new project and research ideas, and enabling the formation of new partnerships. The focal point of the workshop was the conjunction of ICTs, environment, and development. Beginning with pre-workshop conversations via a blog page, the workshop promoted involvement of participants in active exchanges and dialogue through the use of open space processes. Workshop discussions revolved around questions of power and equity, poverty reduction, collective learning, and private sector involvement. The workshop was intended to encourage development organizations to explore alternatives to the traditional deployment approach to ICTs. Workshop participants reflected on the challenges and opportunities of shifting to a systemic learning approach for applying ICTs to SD. A systemic learning model is outlined as a means to enable more effective use of ICTs by balancing technical knowledge with insights into the context and history of the stakeholders and their field of application.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This study examines the online collective process of global trolling of Donald Trump’s inauguration speech. The goal is to identify global trolling behaviors, patterns of global CI, and the role that national culture plays in this context. We performed thematic content analysis of 60 videos (each represents a country) that were posted over a three-week period in 2017, following Trump’s inauguration speech. We found that regardless of country, all the videos exhibit repetitive, provocative, pseudo-sincere, and satirical trolling behaviors; while these trolling behaviors cross national boundaries, the use of certain trolling behaviors correlated with a few of Hofstede’s dimensions of cultural differences. For example, videos from individualistic countries included significantly more instances of trolling behaviors than those from collectivistic countries. We found that in global trolling collective intelligence patterns of replication, innovation, and customization were prominent along with the impact or omission of the original idea. While most of these patterns have been documented by other scholars, we identified the additional pattern of omission that in an extreme case led to a minimalist approach, excluding most of the original idea. This study is unique and timely in that it focuses on global trolling and analyzes internet videos as a medium of trolling.",

    "title": "Curation: a theoretical treatment",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Curation is a key mechanism of sociality in a digital era. With an abundance of information, sifting, sorting, selecting, hiding, and standing out become laborious tasks. While researchers have diligently documented people’s curatorial strategies, digital curation remains undertheorized in its own right. I therefore theorize digital curation by disentangling productive curation from consumptive curation, addressing how people curate content that they share, and that which they consume. I embed these agentic curatorial practices within structural bounds, both social and technological. In doing so, I offer a basic theoretical model that captures a dynamic relationship between individual curators, their social networks, and technological design.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Although studies on gay dating apps have shown the ways through which technical features intervene in sexual sociality, seldom do they shed light on the central feature that undergirds their use ‒ algorithms. This article examines Blued, China’s largest gay dating app, aiming to unfold the data structure and algorithms that navigate the use of its two prime functionalities: browsing and live streaming. Rather than seeing users as passive audiences that are subject to being measured and calculated based on algorithmically filtered information, this article argues that users can act on the data they provide to dating apps to influence and shape the algorithmic dating outcomes. For Blued browsing, gay men are datafied with numbers and tags for users to sort and filter. For Blued live, gay men are evaluated by the yanzhi algorithm, which literally means ‘value of a person’s face’, for users to pinpoint dating goals. By gaming the data and shaping their algorithmic outcomes, an algorithmic sociality is animated through the filter browsing and the yanzhi metric. In this way, algorithms have become ritual tools for gay sociality on Blued. This article ends by opening up critiques on the justification of social biases lurking inside this algorithmic sociality.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT As hiring processes have increasingly moved online, having better digital skills could play an important role in successful job seeking. However, digital inequality suggests that people use the Internet in different ways with varying levels of skills raising questions about who is most likely to be able to search for jobs online, including on social media. This paper examines online job searching, including the role of digital job-search skills in the process. Results show that sociodemographic characteristics (i.e., age, race, education, and income) as well as online experiences, being a social media user, and having higher digital job-search skills relate to online job-seeking behaviors. These findings highlight the presence of digital inequalities in online job searching including differences by social media experiences.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Music streaming services all provide affordable and easy access to massive databases of music and instead attempt to increase customer loyalty by optimizing personalized recommendations and offering opportunities for listeners to build their ‘own’ music libraries. In this paper, these features are operationalized as the convenience, price, archive and algorithmic value of streaming services. Existing studies detail the multitude of ways of making sense of these services, but do not allow for specifying what features matter more. Drawing on an online survey and interviews, this study indicates that price, convenience and archive value predict continued intention to use music streaming services. Survey results negate the importance of algorithmic value, but the interviews suggest that for some, algorithmic individuation is too evasive to be noticed. Those who ‘see’ and value recommendations ‘cater for algorithms’ and consider their own listening and archiving practices as input for optimizing output. Combined, the different features set the stage for both overt and covert tethering of people and streaming services.",

    "title": "Chinese computational propaganda: automation, algorithms and the manipulation of information about Chinese politics on Twitter and Weibo",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT A 2016 review of literature about automation, algorithms and politics identified China as the foremost area in which further research was needed because of the size of its population, the potential for Chinese algorithmic manipulation in the politics of other countries, and the frequency of exportation of Chinese software and hardware. This paper contributes to the small body of knowledge on the first point (domestic automation and opinion manipulation) and presents the first piece of research into the second (international automation and opinion manipulation). Findings are based on an analysis of 1.5 million comments on official political information posts on Weibo and 1.1 million posts using hashtags associated with China and Chinese politics on Twitter. In line with previous research, little evidence of automation was found on Weibo. In contrast, a large amount of automation was found on Twitter. However, contrary to expectations and previous news reports, no evidence was found of pro-Chinese-state automation on Twitter. Automation on Twitter was associated with anti-Chinese-state perspectives and published in simplified Mandarin, presumably aimed at diasporic Chinese and mainland users who ‘jump the wall’ to access blocked platforms. These users come to Twitter seeking more diverse information and an online public sphere but instead they find an information environment in which a small number of anti-Chinese-state voices are attempting to use automation to dominate discourse. Our understanding of public conversation on Twitter in Mandarin is extremely limited and, thus, this paper advances the understanding of political communication on social media.",

    "abstract": "This paper looks at the prevalence of creative activity and sharing in an age when the barriers to disseminating material have been considerably lowered compared with earlier times. The authors use unique data to explore the extent to which young adults create video, music, writing and artistic photography, as well as the prevalence of sharing such material online. Findings suggest that despite new opportunities to engage in such distribution of content, relatively few people are taking advantage of these recent developments. Moreover, neither creation nor sharing is randomly distributed among a diverse group of young adults. Consistent with existing literature, creative activity is related to a person's socioeconomic status as measured by parental schooling. The novel act of sharing online, however, is considerably different by gender with men much more likely to engage in it. However, once internet user skill is controlled for, men and women are equally likely to post their materials on the Web.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article is part of the outcomes of the Transmedia Literacy research project on teens and transmedia collaborative practices carried out in eight countries between 2015 and 2018. A multi-method approach was used in the study (questionnaires, workshops, media diaries, interviews, observation of online communities) to explore what teens are doing with media. This article presents a map of the uses and practices teens make of YouTube. The metaphors of YouTube that emerged when teens put these uses and practices into discourse are also identified. Five YouTube uses were detected: radiophonic, televisual, social, productive and educative. These uses vary according to the practices performed by teens and how they are related to the logics of the YouTube platform. Moreover, the identified metaphors show the ways teens’ uses are related to their everyday routines and the way they integrate the YouTube platform into various dimensions of their social life, such as their media practices, and the way they acquire knowledge and skills.",

    "title": "Caring masculinity as caring capital in the field of marriage: Chinese rural migrant men’s engagement with digital dating",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The concept of hegemonic masculinity has been used in Chinese sociology since the early-2020s to explain Chinese wealthy men’s power over women in the market reform era. Scholars have also paid attention to the ways in which rural, working-class men achieve a sense of manhood, but the links between digital media and gender theory have often not been explored. To fill in this gap, this article examines the ways in which Chinese rural migrant heterosexual men sophisticatedly employ digital technology and gain advantages in the highly competitive field of marriage, translating savvy digital media usage into cultural capital. Research findings drawing upon our long-term ethnography offer substantial evidence of a relationship between men’s active use of digital technology, caring practices, and the desirability of rural migrant men. As such, we develop the concept of caring capital in relation to men’s ability to: master romantic online courting manners, display caring behaviors during follow-up offline courtship, and please their (future) parents-in-law. Research limitations are discussed.",

Using qualitative and quantitative evidence we analyse how Chinese Canadian entrepreneurs combine the Internet and airplane travel in their business activities. Our results show that the use of new communication and transportation technologies are positively related to the creation and maintenance of ‘glocalized’ networks, a function of both local embeddedness and global outreach. We find that online interaction cannot replace face-to-face interaction; travel abroad is crucial for adding a human touch to glocalized networks. Moreover, while technologies help to liberate communication from being local, Internet use and travel have limited impact on the ethnic diversity of the entrepreneurs' social networks.",

    "abstract": "Despite the popularity of social network sites based on common interests, the association between these shared interests and relational development is not well understood. This manuscript reports results of an empirical investigation of interpersonal relationships on Last.fm, a music-based social network site with a multinational user base. In addition to baseline descriptors of relational behavior, the chief goals of this study were to examine the degree to which Last.fm relationships are characterized by homophily (and particularly by shared musical taste), the extent to which communication via Last.fm is associated with other forms of communication (both offline and online), how such communication behavior is associated with demographic and relational characteristics, and whether these variables predict strength of relational development. Results indicate that although Last.fm relational partners exhibit shared musical taste, this shared taste is not associated with relational development. Rather, following media multiplexity theory, relational development is strongly and uniquely associated with communication behavior across almost all forms of communication (including Last.fm). These results suggest that shared interests may foster the creation of weak ties, but conversion of these connections to strong ties is relatively rare.",

    "abstract": "This paper considers the popularity and social significance of the gaming series Championship Manager/Football Manager. Sport-related games continue to be one of the most popular forms of digital gaming, and the series has proved to be one of the most successful of all time. Drawing on 32 interviews with game players and developers of this series, this paper argues that this series has proved particularly popular due to its ‘intertextual’ links to the sport of football, which allows this game to be drawn on as a resource in conversations and social networks. In particular, this paper argues that aspects of gaming, such as performativity and control, extend and cross-cut with wider social formations. Hence, the author argues that it is crucial that considerations of digital games seek to locate these within wider social and cultural patterns.",

    "title": "THE INTERPENETRATION OF TECHNICAL AND LEGAL DECISION-MAKING FOR THE INTERNET",
    "abstract": "Not long after computer scientists first began working on the technical design of the network that ultimately became known as the Internet, in 1969, they began to document their discussions, information shared, and decisions made in a series of documents known as the Internet requests for comments that is still being used for this purpose 40 years later. A comprehensive inductive reading of these documents reveals that legal and policy issues were often raised or confronted in the course of resolving technical problems. In many of these instances, the technical decisions that resulted had law-like effects in the sense that they constrained or enabled the ways in which users can communicate and can access and use information over the Internet, whether or not such decisions supported or subverted legal decision-making, and whether or not legal decision-makers understood the societal implications of the technical decisions that were being made. This is one of the two ways in which technical and legal decision-making have become interpenetrated. The literature on legal engagement with problems generated by the technical features of the Internet is vast. This article appears within the nascent literature on technical engagement with legal problems. It does so in an effort to contribute to the building of a shared epistemic and decision-making space that involves both the technical and the legal communities.",

    "abstract": "This study focuses on teens' use of communication technologies to maintain connections with people from their everyday peer group. It departs from a pre-defined network (in a secondary school in Flanders, Belgium) and investigates how friendship type and clique formation (an important dynamic in this (micro) context) are related to face-to-face communication (FTFC) and the use of email, instant messaging, text messaging, telephone and social network sites in this network. Hypotheses/expectations were derived from network theory and (qualitative and quantitative) studies on the social affordances of communication technologies for adolescents. Data were collected among the 78 pupils of a fourth grade (15–16-year-olds) in a Belgian secondary school. First, dyadic quadratic assignment procedure regression analyses were run to explain the frequency of FTFC and communication through different technologies by looking at dyad characteristics (strength of ties, number of friends in common, same sex…). Second, FTFC and communication through technologies were compared for in-group versus out-group ties. The analyses show that the patterns of FTFC were sometimes reproduced (and therefore extended), and sometimes deviated from in communication through technologies. The specific function each of the studied technologies fulfilled in relation to social structure (in this network) is addressed in the discussion.",

    "title": "SYMBOLIC PRODUCTION, REPRESENTATION, AND CONTESTED IDENTITIES",
    "abstract": "The increased flexibility facilitated by Information and Communication Technologies has enabled anti-war activists to garner great control over representations of their arguments. This paper explores the value of the symbolic dimension of collective action through three cumulative forms of analysis: understanding how the symbolic domain is used; explaining the strategic choices behind this use; and, finally, linking these representational choices to the subjective experience of the individual and their processes of political identity construction. Many groups lacked a coherent online strategy. The reasons for this are threefold. First, use reflects the organizational structure and ideological principles of the groups. Second, by emphasizing diversity and inclusion most groups wanted their online material to be as accessible as possible and as a result censored anything too opinionated or deemed too radical. Third, there was an enduring emphasis upon local place and face-to-face communication. This made groups' online interventions lack coherence because they were often aiming their representations at particular populations. In a study of Muslim anti-war activism the relationship between these representational choices and the processes of identity construction were explored. Muslim activists sought support by asserting a collective religious commonality and by aligning with sympathetic others to counter stereotypes of Muslims as terrorists. This re-ignited a historical tension as to the place of religion within anti-war activism. Consequently, Muslims struggled to articulate their claim to multiple identities, and online representations limited those who attempted to develop overt and complicated new religious political identities.",

    "abstract": "This paper argues that the concept of Information Society fails as theory because it is internally incoherent and unsupported by evidence. Its current popularity within policy discourse can only be understood ideologically. In particular it is argued that one of the drivers of current policy towards higher education is based upon the supposed growth of knowledge work linked to a theory of human capital formation as crucial to international competitiveness and to an explanation of unemployment in terms of a skills gap. The paper goes on to argue that current labour market indicators and research into the skills gap do not support this policy thrust and that a better explanation of the current push towards the creation of virtual universities is the desire to cut educational labour costs rather than to upgrade the economic status of so-called knowledge workers.",

    "title": "Critical Theory, Information Society and Surveillance Technologies",
    "abstract": "This article offers an account of information and communication technologies (ICTs) that draws upon the tradition of critical theory, arguing that an application of the latter to the former can be categorized as a theory of 'cyber criticalism'. Its aim is not to provide an exhaustive theoretical analysis or any kind of literature review, but to suggest that such a theorization is possible because cyber criticalism (1) offers an account of social power and (2) suggests how and why alternatives to existing social practices and institutions can be formed. The first section relates the debate about information society to that concerning globalization and argues that two main theories square off against each other in the race to explain that society: one which, in Castells's terminology, emphasizes the power of flows and the other which emphasizes the flows of power. If the former is inadequate in crucial respects then the way is clear for critical theorists to explore the latter. Cyber criticalism is then sketched in outline and the article proceeds to identify information systems, the flows of power, as potential sites of resistance. The final section focuses upon biometrics and argues that the way forward for cyber critical theorists lies in exploiting the cultural insecurities of informatic capitalism. Ultimately, then, cyber criticalism is critical theory updated for the information age. Unlike those such as Castells it identifies flows of power and the intensification of those flows around the dominant nodes of the informational net. It insists that information systems constitute potential sites of resistance. Nevertheless, acts of resistance are still relatively marginal and fragmented events due to they way in which social problems are pathologized and criminalized.",

    "abstract": "Research on internet politics has found that digital media have contributed to a hybridization of the organizational practices of parties, movements and interest groups. Little attention, however, has been paid to how the news media employ online engagement tools to pursue political goals, as is the case when political parallelism is present. This study addresses this issue through an in-depth analysis of two Italian cases: the e-petition campaigns by the newspaper la Repubblica and the assemblage of a convergent media network to broadcast a protest rally organized by the television talk show host Michele Santoro. Online citizen engagement now constitutes a valuable political resource for journalists and news organizations that have historically been involved in the political battlefield rather than practicing objectivity and neutrality. However, these efforts are limited in their democratic potential to the extent that they constitute top-down leveraging of audience support by media elites rather than grassroots channels for citizens to set the agenda and voice their opinions. The relevance of these phenomena goes well beyond Italy, as parts of the media systems of most Western democracies are characterized by political parallelism.",

This article focuses on the Google game Ingress, which combines augmented reality with geomedia to create a robust and complex digital narrative. More importantly, Ingress combines globalism with regionalism in a way that rewrites the regional as global, and vice versa. In turn, the transformative nature of the smaller real-world regionalist narratives help to lend ethos to the overarching globalist (fictional) narrative within the game world. Through narrative analysis of this transmedia game world and community, this article considers ways that information and communications technologies are able to use storytelling to negotiate complex relationships between the regional and the global.",

    "title": "Social networking sites and low-income teenagers: between opportunity and inequality",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Recent studies on social networking sites (SNSs) reveal that users’ social background is not a significant predictor of participation in this type of social media. The broad user bases of Facebook and other social media platforms also appear to suggest that social background no longer affects access to SNSs. A small number of studies even claim that in the participatory web environment, social content is more likely to be created by non-elites, such as lower-income people or racial minorities [Blank, G. (2013). Who creates content? Stratification and content creation on the Internet. Information, Communication & Society, 16(4), 590–612]. Nevertheless, engagement with SNSs also reproduces inequalities, for example via class- and ethnic-based ‘self-segregation’ [boyd, d. (2012). White flight in networked publics? How race and class shaped American teen engagement with MySpace and Facebook. In L. Nakamura & P. A. Chow-White (Eds.), Race after the internet (pp. 203–222). New York, NY: Routledge]. Drawing on a large-scale survey (N = 2327) and a set of 56 interviews with Italian teenagers, the current paper explores the persistent influence of socio-economic background and cultural capital in adolescents’ use of SNSs. The research findings show that, although structural variables inevitably influence their participation in social media, teenagers from ‘lower-income’ families are more enthusiastic about the communication and relational features of these sites. In contrast, their peers from ‘elite’ families focus on the capital-enhancing opportunities offered by SNSs and display a critical stance that leads them to limit their social activities on these platforms. Overall, the results suggest that SNSs are not exempt from digital inequalities, but nonetheless provide novel opportunities to lower-income teenagers.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Studies adopting the media ecology metaphor to investigate social movements form a promising strand of literature that has emerged in the last years to overcome the communicative reductionism permeating the study of the relation between social movements and communication technologies. However, contributions that apply ecological visions to protest are scattered, and only seldom connect their analyses to more general media ecological frameworks. The article critically reviews and classifies the diverse strands of scholarship that adopt the ecological metaphor in their exploration of activism, and connects them with the more general literature on media and communication ecologies. Moreover, it extracts the constitutive elements of this literature that can help scholars to better address the complexity of communication within social movements, and it articulates four key lessons that a media ecology lens brings to the understanding of media and protest. Finally, the article further demonstrates the strengths of this approach through an illustration of the preliminary findings of an ongoing investigation on the 15M movement in Spain.",

    "title": "THE PRACTISES OF INTERNET NETWORKING – A RESOURCE FOR ALTERNATIVE POLITICAL MOVEMENTS",
    "abstract": "Over the past ten years, the political significance of the Internet has become a recurrent theme within the social science literature, with questions centring on the Internet's part in the emergence of political movements and in the reshaping of people's roles as citizens. These discussions have been predominantly theoretical and deterministic in nature, with the political significance of the Internet being viewed as a consequence of its features; for example, the Internet's network structure is addressed within this literature as a forerunner to a politics following network logic. For the most part, extant research has not told us much about the Internet's significance in individuals' everyday political engagement. This article aims to modestly compensate for this shortcoming by presenting empirical results from a study on the perception and use of the Internet among young people in four alternative political movements. Specifically, by drawing on semi-structured interviews with twenty-one activists and viewing the interview data through the lens of the ‘network metaphor’, the article illustrates and discusses three different networking practises in which the Internet is an important resource: (1) the activists' use of the Internet to maintain their organizations' network-like character, (2) their use of the Internet for networking within their organizations, and (3) their use of the Internet for networking in between different, alternative political organizations. The article concludes by discussing the potential significance of these networking practises for politics, and presenting a comparative outlook towards a similar, previous study of young members within established political parties' youth organizations.",

    "title": "The mobile phone: Towards new categories and social relations1",
    "abstract": "Abstract The debate over the social use of the mobile phone has been enriched by a large amount of information and reflection as to how this instrument has modified interpersonal relations, changed roles in the family, re‐defined the limits of communicative possibilities, rewritten the present functioning of institutions such as hospitals and schools, as well as the modus operandi of criminal organizations, intensified work rhythms, rationalized the organization of work relations, in a word, how the use of the mobile has profoundly changed society.2 On the contrary, less attention has been dedicated to the reconstruction and analysis of the impulse that its users have given the mobile (see its unexpected transformation, from the king of orality to a means of writing and reading). The main thesis of this article is that the mobile is changing not only society, but above all the framework in which society lives. This framework is made up of space and time as its primary determinations, which are able to integrate, stabilize and structure reality. The mobile changes reality in its widest sense, or rather its social representation. Let us remember with McLuhan (1964), Meyrowitz (1985) and many other scholars, that the medium is not only the message, but also a specific concept of time and space, that is, a specific dimension of existence. In the following sections, above all the changes that have been brought about to space and time will be dealt with, and then how the statute of the presence and absence of individuals in social space is modified will be analysed, how the relation between modern citizens changes radically with public space, and finally how the democratic process is enriched by further implementations.",

    "abstract": "Despite the importance of digital music in most young people's lives, there has been little academic research into the meanings attached to these acquisitions and the patterns of organization of and access to them. This study reviewed the existing research into music collections, and interviewed 35 young people whose first music acquisitions were music files or whose current collections consisted predominantly of music files. The results suggest that many young people have acquired a large amount of music in file formats, and relate to their music in ways that show their music functions as a ‘collection.’ The examination of personal archives of music primarily existing as music files suggests that the process of classifying, organizing and accessing music that has no physical or material presence gives it a materiality.",

    "title": "FEMINISM, TECHNOLOGY AND THE INFORMATION SOCIETY Learning from the past, imagining the future",
    "abstract": "This article examines second wave and post-second wave feminist writing about the possibilities of (contemporaneously) new information and communication technologies. A number of texts by key authors, including Shulamith Firestone, Valerie Solanas, Cynthia Cockburn, Donna Haraway and Sadie Plant, are examined in light of the social and political context of their time of writing as well as in relation to ‘mainstream’ information society theorists such as Daniel Bell and Manuel Castells. The main focus is on how these authors understand the transformative potential of technologies, and attention is drawn to the swings between optimism and pessimism about the role of technology for a feminist political agenda. The role and nature of manifestos are also explored, and the question of whether it is time for another feminist technology manifesto is raised. The article concludes by posing some methodological and theoretical challenges of developing an anti-essentialist (in relation to both gender and technology), politically engaged and relevant feminist research agenda that takes seriously both lived experience and structures of power. The footnotes are an experiment in autobiographical writing in which I make explicit my own connection to this literature and the politics of these debates.",

    "title": "Negotiating gender scripts in mobile dating apps: between affordances, usage norms and practices",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The paper explores the perception and negotiation of gender representations and scripts among Italian dating app users. Adopting a gender perspective and a socio-technical framework, it describes how dating app affordances support the performance of gender scripts and explores how users negotiate gender scripts. We conducted 8 focus groups involving 39 dating app users from a variety of gender and sexual orientations. The results show how shared usage norms and practices disclose dominant gender scripts at play, and illustrate how some users try to subvert them. Participants are aware of a number of traditional and stereotypical gender scripts and broadly adhere to them; nevertheless, such scripts are partially reframed in the context of dating apps. Dating apps are mainly understood in terms of affordances, when participants highlight the ways in which they or their mates reduce the incidence of traditional scripts. On the other hand, dating apps’ constraints emerge when some users try to detach themselves from common scripts, or when they struggle to perform traditional scripts in a context they perceive as inadequate. Results highlight how dating app users negotiate gender scripts: affordances and constraints of dating apps shape user practices and influence the performance and ‘de-inscription’ of gender scripts, without directly fostering the adoption of alternative scripts.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT How-to videos on YouTube have become a popular source for procedural learning. An important difference to traditional educational videos is that the instructor is often not a professional educator, but an amateur or peer. Building on work on social learning from models, this paper explores how instructor characteristics such as model-observer similarity, instructor credibility (expertise, trustworthiness, attractiveness), and conversational human voice influence choice and evaluation of a how-to video. A survey (n = 401) among active Internet users was conducted. Most respondents had used YouTube and had watched how-to videos on YouTube. Respondents preferred videos with instructors that they perceived as experts and trustworthy, and who talked in a conversational human voice. Instructors of the same gender as the viewer were also preferred, especially by males. The instructor variables explained variance in perceived usefulness and intention to use how-to videos above and beyond the technical and instructional quality of the video. However, only conversational human voice and same gender of the instructor turned out to be significant predictors of perceived usefulness and intention to use.",

    "title": "‘Live’ to ‘survive’: women and digital political communication in Tunisia",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This study examines how social media platforms can facilitate greater visibility of Tunisian women in political communication activism to survive male politicians’ domination and the conventional media's boycott. The authors chose to focus on the case of Tunisian activist Abir Moussi to investigate how she uses Facebook for political mobilization and self-branding purposes. A monographic approach to the content of the Facebook page was carried out, along with a semiotic analysis of the speech given by Moussi on the decisions announced by President Kais Said on 25 July 2021. The results revealed a Facebook-Live-based communication strategy to address audiences as well as a large number of photos and videos. Besides, The Tunisian political activist used several linguistic elements in her discourse to make her political discourse effective, such as contrast, intertextuality, metaphor, etc. Unlike President Said, who uses Standard Arabic, the Tunisian political activist speaks the Tunisian dialect; Abir’s tone ranges from humorous, enthusiastic, provocative, menacing and promising; she provides her propaganda speech with legal texts and arguments to convince her audience, claiming to enlighten minds by simplifying ordinances and complex political terms. Moreover, she revealed several political and economic ‘hot issues’ that led to the Tunisian crisis. The authors conclude that social media does not create new ways of activism but rather amplifies traditional ones; they suggest enhancing the political efficacy of social media to boost political activism and emphasizing the concept of ‘online political efficacy’ in future research.",

    "abstract": "Writers in information and communication studies often assume the stability of objects under investigation: network nodes, databases, information. Legal writers in the intellectual property tradition often assume that cultural artefacts exist as objects prior to being governed by copyright law. Both assumptions are fallacious. This introduction conceptualizes the relationship of legal form and cultural symbol. Starting from an understanding of copyright law as part of systems of cultural production, it is argued that copyright law constructs the artefacts it seeks to regulate as objects that can be bought and sold. In doing so, the legal and aesthetic logic of cultural symbols may clash, as in the case of digital music (the central focus of this special issue).",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of Internet technologies has paved the way for technology adoption among marginalized communities and individuals for advancing varied political and civic agendas. Social movement scholars advocate that technology is becoming an integral component of the social movement repertoire, and building on their work, Internet scholars have examined the evolving nature of movement organizations and formal networks. Adopting resource mobilization and social network theories as the conceptual framework, this study examines political bloggers' social networks. Through 41 in-depth interviews and 76 survey responses, we collected data on political bloggers' activism participation and their organizational affiliations. Social networking patterns are linked to different organizational affiliation types – membership with formal organizations rooted in the offline context; membership with issue-based online organizations which assume a temporal nature and non-membership. Focusing on the dialectics between offline and online, permanence and temporality, the study showed that activists who belonged to offline-based organizations experienced greater social influence and collectiveness with one another. However, activist bloggers who belonged to online-based groups shared strong ties and sustained communication even after a campaign ended. More significantly, the findings show that online movement groups, although temporal in nature, foster what Sunstein [(2009). Republic.com 2.0 (pp. 19–45). Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press] termed as ‘enclave deliberation’, attributed to the inclusive and open networks of online-based movement organizations.",

    "abstract": "This article uses interviews with committed anti-war and peace activists to offer an overview of both the benefits and challenges that social movements derive from new communication technologies. It shows contemporary political activism to be intensely informational; dependent on the sensitive adoption of a wide range of communication technologies. A hyperlink analysis is then employed to map the UK anti-war movement as it appears online. Through comparing these two sets of data it becomes possible to contrast the online practices of the UK anti-war movement with its offline ‘reality’. When encountered away from the web, recent anti-war contention is grounded in national-level political realities and internally divided by its political diversity; but to the extent that experience of the movement is mediated online, it routinely transcends national and political boundaries.",

While advertiser support for traditional news media has been dropping, activities of online ‘citizen journalists’ have been on the rise. A key question for both traditional news organizations and citizen journalists is who will pay for online news. In-depth interviews were used to gain insight into consumer understanding of changes in the relationship between news and advertising as both adapt to the online environment. Three types of news and advertising users emerged: engagers, receivers, and avoiders. The research also identified three approaches to user-generated content: broad participation, participation primarily in interpersonal exchanges, and avoidance.

    "title": "Gay men's digital cultures beyond Gaydar and Grindr: LINE use in the gay Chinese diaspora of Australia",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Recent research on gay men's digital cultures has focused predominantly on Western, English-language-based sites and populations. In the case of Australia, a country with an official multiculturalism framework in place and against a backdrop of significant levels of Asian immigration over the past several decades, a more pluralistic approach is needed to critically interrogate the dialectic between platforms, users and wider sociocultural complexities. To this end, the current paper presents research in progress on the social chat application LINE and its use amongst the Chinese diaspora of gay men in Australia. Drawing on data from participant observation carried out over several months during late 2015 and early 2016 in an Australian-based LINE group for local Chinese gay men, we highlight here how LINE functions as an important intermediary for many Chinese men engaging with gay men's digital cultures in this context. In particular, we show how LINE plays a crucial role in Chinese gay men's engagements with gay men's digital culture in Australia by (1) mediating this group's navigations of new social and cultural environments and (2) remediating their experiences within other platforms central to the broader GLBT community.",

    "abstract": "Many commentators have emphasized the important role which new information and communication technologies (ICTs) have played in shaping the global network economy. Yet its potential function as a tool for resistance by those who wish to protest against global corporatism has perhaps been less well developed. Our first article in this issue of iCS by Peter Van Aelst and Stefaan Walgrave provides a cautious but illuminating exploration of the use by anti-neo-liberal globalization groups of websites as a means of political activism. A systematic study of seventeen websites was undertaken to assess the extent to which the new media could be said to be facilitating a global social movement. This was addressed by analysing the extent to which the sites contributed to the development of a collective identity, stimulated actual mobilization, and facilitated a (global) network of organizations. On all three dimensions Van Aelst and Walgrave suggest that a relatively positive conclusion can be drawn. Nonetheless, such findings they maintain should be regarded as evidence of the Internet as a powerful tool which the protesters have been quick to utilize as a valuable addition to existing activity rather than as ah entirely new 'logic of collective action'.",

Online surveys and focus group interviews in Canada and the UK illustrate active audience participation in the converged era of print books, the internet, television and radio.

    "title": "Computerizing the welfare state",
    "abstract": "Although computer technology is central to the operation of the modern welfare state, there has been little analysis of its role or of the factors shaping the way in which it is used. Using data generated by expert informants from 13 OECD countries, this paper provides an indicative comparison of the aims of computerization in national social security systems over a 15-year period from 1985 to 2000. The paper seeks to identify and explain patterns in the data and outlines and examines four hypotheses. Building on social constructivist accounts of technology, the first three hypotheses attribute variations in the aims of computerization to different welfare state regimes, forms of capitalism, and structures of public administration. The fourth hypothesis, which plays down the importance of social factors, assumes that computerization is adopted as a means of improving operational efficiency and generating expenditure savings. The findings suggest that, in all 13 countries, computerization was adopted in the expectation that it would lead to increased productivity and higher standards of performance, thus providing most support for the fourth hypothesis. However, variations between countries suggest that the sociopolitical values associated with different welfare state regimes have also had some effect in shaping the ways in which computer technology has been used in national social security systems.",

    "abstract": "Both practitioners and researchers embrace the increasing volume of digital data to measure and understand audiences. This study focuses on Twitter use during an eminent Belgian current affairs television (TV) programme to investigate how people talk about TV on Twitter. The main objective of the study is to understand how we can interpret these digital traces and, in extension, discuss its utility and value for audience studies. More specifically, we define two validity issues related to the use of social media data: that is, the technological bias of data analysis and the alleged objectivity of the data. These issues are addressed through the combination of Twitter data and user insights. In particular, we focus on interaction patterns and the content of Twitter messages in relation to TV content. We compliment these analyses with in-depth interviews with a selection of Twitter users. The results confirm the variations and complexities of the use of digital objects such as the @-sign and the hashtag. In addition, although Twitter messages are unobtrusive measures, they reflect performances in the sense that they entail interpretations as well as representations of the self and one's programme taste. Users predominantly feel the need to scrutinize the actions and utterances of politicians and experts. The use of irony and sarcasm exemplifies the playfulness and fun factor of these activities. To conclude, we elaborate on the results in relation to the validity issues we put forth and discuss methodological and epistemological concerns related to the use of social media data in audience studies.",

    "title": "Civil society, cosmopolitics and the net: The legacy of 15 February 2003",
    "abstract": "The global demonstrations on 15 February 2003 against the impending invasion of Iraq were on an unprecedented scale, and generated a great deal of commentary and debate. One response was that of Jürgen Habermas, supported by Jacques Derrida, who in an article entitled, ‘February 15, or What Binds Europeans Together: A Plea for a Common European Foreign Policy, Beginning in the Core of Europe’, suggests the events may be a ‘sign of the birth of a European public sphere’ and used the occasion to launch a call for a common European foreign and defence policy. In response to that piece this article questions whether the events of 15 February can really be seen as such a birth date, and argues that what the demonstrations indicate is rather the maturing of a global civil society. The role of technology, specifically the Internet, in the organization and form of the protests is ignored by Habermas in his analysis, and results in a blind spot concerning the events, which misses some of its most important elements. Rather than calling for a common European foreign and defence policy we should be looking towards a ‘double democratization’ on a global scale that reflects the significance of global civil society in the formal structures of a global parliament, and that must address technology as an important element in generating participation and deliberation amongst a global citizenry.",

    "title": "Reading Walter Benjamin and Donna Haraway in the age of digital reproduction",
    "abstract": "Abstract Walter Benjamin's ‘The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction’ has much to offer contemporary analyses of the ‘Information Age’. This article rereads this famous essay in light of a later intervention by Donna Haraway, ‘A Manifesto for Cyborgs: Science, Technology, and Socialist Feminism in the 1980s’. There are strong parallels and overlaps between these two groundbreaking pieces, despite their many differences. Both deal with how their respective generations of ‘new’ information and communication technologies (ICTs) are intertwined with broader sociocultural and political economic change. Both apply controversial, Marxian, theoretical insights to changes in the mode of (re)production in their analyses of techno‐economic change that herald both negative and positive political possibilities. This article takes Benjamin and Haraway in turn, their lives and their work in general and these two essays in particular. It concludes with a brief discussion on how Benjamin's and Haraway's optimistic takes on technological change ‐ as political opportunity, despite less than optimal tendencies in the political economic and technical apparatus of their respective ages ‐ can contribute to fleshing out theory and research on ICTs. And to do so without lurching between the positions of extreme pessimism or optimism that characterize the debates to date.",

    "abstract": "Korea has shown rapid growth in the development of broadband services over the last several years. The Korean government and business have developed broadband services as a new business model, and the country has emerged as the world's undisputed leader in broadband services. Many media scholars, government telecom officials and information technology (IT) experts around the world are interested in how Korea has so quickly embraced broadband technology. They are also enthusiastic about seeing the fulfilment of their own vision of the information economy through the example of broadband service in Korea. This article explores key aspects of broadband services in Korea and its implications for the information economy. It examines why and how Korea has developed broadband service by examining several institutional factors. It also analyses whether government ICT policy frameworks have contributed to economic and social development. Then, it investigates how the government neoliberal economic policies have influenced the transnationalization of the broadband service market and the impact on the information economy.",

    "title": "NON-ADOPTION OF THE INTERNET IN GREAT BRITAIN AND SWEDEN",
    "abstract": "Non-use of the Internet has often been researched within the topic of digital divides. The focus of these studies lay mainly on differences in socio-economic backgrounds and resources. This paper goes one step further by attempting to describe various groups of non-users in two highly developed European countries: Great Britain and Sweden. Results from descriptive analyses, multivariate regressions, and principal components analysis with two waves of comparable data from 2007 and 2009 show a more heterogeneous non-user population in Great Britain and a slightly more homogeneous one in Sweden. Socio-economic factors play a bigger role in influencing who is going online in Britain than in Sweden. Education, occupational status, and household income are significant determinants in both countries. The most important determinants of Internet adoption are age and occupational status. The analysis of a 25–55-year-old sub-sample shows that non-users from this age group feature different socio-economic characteristics from older age groups. Middle-aged British non-users share two specific socio-economic characteristics: low income and unemployment; 25–55-year-old Swedish non-users tend to have low incomes, be unemployed, and be single. Non-users' self-assessment of reasons for non-use do not seem to be consistent with the ‘raw data’. Non-users mainly state that they are not interested in the Internet. Many non-users share sceptical attitudes about the Internet, which influences interest in them. There needs to be more detailed research to know exactly which people are not using the Internet and why.",

    "abstract": "This paper tests the ‘leap-frog’ hypothesis by modeling the impact of existing telecommunications infrastructure, controlling for economic, political and demographic factors, on changes in information communication technology (ICT) access for over 200 countries between 1995 and 2005. This study has significantly greater coverage than previous research, in terms of both time frame and country cases. First, the analysis demonstrates that in the first decade of the information society successful leap-frog countries are few and far between. Second, the relative distribution of personal computers, internet hosts and secure servers among the nations of the world has barely improved over the last decade. Third, contrary to received wisdom, most of the countries that might qualify as successful leap-frog countries are actually among the wealthiest in the world. Finally, while policy reform in the telecommunications sector can sometimes speed the diffusion of digital communication tools, the record of market reforms is mixed, and the overall effect of economic wealth is still paramount. In sum, a few poor countries have leapt ahead in the development of a few aspects of ICT infrastructure and use, but these relatively rare successes are more likely to be due to economic productivity than to privatization, regulatory separation and depoliticization, or market liberalization in the telecommunications sector.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The article applies the critical lens of sphere transgression to the field of law, with a particular focus on legal dispute resolution. The engagement of technology corporations with dispute resolution is described in terms of either facilitation or disruption, depending on whether the corporations aim at modernizing the existing justice system, or substituting it with their own adjudicative institutions. The article argues that, while facilitation can be understood as a transgression of technology into the sphere of law, disruption ultimately amounts to a counter-transgression of law into the sphere of digital goods. These observations help illustrate the usefulness of sphere transgression as a critical lens.",

    "title": "Counter-surveillance and alternative new media in Turkey",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This study, drawing on alternative media and networked social movements, explores the counter-surveillance practices and oppositional imaginaries of activist citizen journalists (ACJs) in Turkey to combat the surveillance strategies of the authoritarian Turkish government. After the failed coup attempt in July 2016, the ruling party has become more suspicious of dissent of any kind. However, the ACJs who use mobile communication and social media as channels for journalism and counter-surveillance continue their critical journalistic work in this context. Using ethnographic data collected from interviews with these media activists, this study focuses on oppositional imaginaries regarding the surveillance culture as well as counter-surveillance tactics, both offensive and defensive. To do so, we conducted 22 in-depth interviews with the representatives of alternative new media (ANM) initiatives and ACJs who were gathering, producing and disseminating news at the time of the study (between January and July 2017). Backed by the available literature on interdisciplinary approaches, data were gathered from the interviews, thematically coded and critically analysed. The whole process of news-making that criticises the authoritarian surveillance state stands out as an offensive tactic. On the other hand, defensive tactics are very closely related to the safety of journalists, their sources and data. The paper argues that the variety of offensive and defensive tactics should be increased and they should be substantially improved. The study also sheds light on the need for more detailed and extensive interdisciplinary research.",

    "title": "Beyond platform-centrism and digital universalism: the relational affordances of mobile social media publics",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In debates on digital affordances, mobile devices and social media platforms are often treated as separate (physical or digital) objects which function independently from each other and from the environments in which they are used (‘platform-centrism’). However, mobile phone use has increasingly been dominated by social media apps while social media are frequently accessed via mobile devices, particularly in Global South contexts where users often rely on mobile-only internet access via subsidized/zero-rated social media data bundles. Furthermore, the affordances of mobile social media are shaped by the physical, mediated and political contexts in which they are used. Technological affordances are far from universal (‘digital universalism’) but take on different shapes across the globe. Drawing on research carried out during the September 2011 Zambian elections, this article introduces the notion of ‘relational affordance’ to emphasize the interplay between mobile social media, users and their varied contexts. Despite the relatively low number of mobile internet users at the time, the Facebook group of the popular, privately-owned Zambian television station, Muvi TV, quickly emerged as a fast-paced forum for the sharing of information on the elections. Three ‘relational affordances’ – infrastructure, home-based access and temporality – help to explain the emergence of this active mobile social media public. This analysis challenges previous accounts of mobile social media publics which identified negative (constraining) affordances like the control exerted by Facebook page administrators and positive (enabling) affordances such as the ‘always-on’ nature of mobile social media use and their ‘on-the-go’ access in public spaces.",

    "abstract": "Online information pools, such as user-generated encyclopedias and websites that aggregate users' ratings of various products and experiences, are increasingly popular venues where people seek out and share information. While cues about the identity of information sources may be limited in these venues, they may nonetheless incite a sense of shared group membership and social identity among users. This study applies Social Identity Theory and Self-Categorization Theory to examine the effects of group identification on people's information contribution and evaluation behaviors in online information pools. Experimental results indicate that shared group identification positively influences motivation, which in turn influences contribution to information pools. Additionally, people tend to find information contributed by similar others to be more credible and they are also more likely to indicate that they will act on this information. The implications of these findings on the sustenance of information pools, and for information sharing in the contemporary media environment more broadly, are discussed.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT How can we explain the multiple uses that media organizations make of media technologies across the world? This paper proposes a hybrid conceptual framework that synthesizes ideas from the sociology of knowledge approach to discourse with science & technology studies concepts (i.e., script and technological frame) in order to emphasize the importance of policy and organizational discourses in shaping multiple uses of media technologies by media organizations. We apply the conceptual framework to study the case of Mídia NINJA, a Brazilian alternative media that gained popularity due to its innovative coverage of the 2013 riots in the country through collaborative practices and digital media technologies. Based on interviews and participant observation, we found that policy discourses to change the media structure influenced in time the discourse and practices of this alternative media in Brazil, leading to new uses of digital media technologies unintended by its designers. Thereby illustrating the importance of discourses to shape within certain boundaries the multiple uses of media technologies.",

    "title": "Rage against the streaming studio system: worker resistance to Hollywood’s networked era",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Every global media conglomerate in the United States has a streaming video platform. Unlike their streaming competitors from Silicon Valley, the early years of Hollywood streaming push emerges from a Studio System. The emergent Streaming Studio System is not as integrated as the Classic Hollywood Studio System, but it shares some important similarities. Most important is the seamless integration of production, distribution, and exhibition. The streamers increasingly make and release projects exclusively to consumers via exhibition portals they control. But workers are fighting back against the power of the streamers as they exacerbate inequality and working conditions in the media industry, mirroring the widening inequality at the dawn of the twenty-first century. They are using the more open digital platforms to organize and share their stories. This article explores worker strategies for resisting Hollywood’s digital empire in three ways: (1) a survey of film/TV workers in Chicago, a regional hub for ‘runaway production’ where state tax credits lowers production costs to allow for increases in production; (2) an analysis of stories posted to the @ia_stories page of crew members represented by the IATSE union; and (3) an analysis of ‘above-the-line’ activism, including solidarity campaigns launched after the 2020 #BlackLivesMatter protests (e.g., #EndLatinXClusion, #Hollywood4BlackLives, #ChangeHollywood), contractual innovations from advocacy groups like Color of Change’s Inclusion Rider, and the threat of another Writers Guild strike.",

    "title": "Framing Smart Nation: A moderated mediation analysis of frame-focus effects",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The rise of smart cities has emerged as a key policy thread that unites various government agencies in pursuit of a common objective: to become a digital city. However, these smart initiatives generate tradeoffs between economic growth and privacy concerns, with emphasis placed on data sharing for innovation, and surveillance for cybersecurity purposes. This study examines media framing in Singapore’s Smart Nation initiatives. A between-subject experiment investigated the effect of news frames (gain versus loss) and regulatory focus (prevention versus promotion) on respondents’ (N = 157) opinions toward the Smart Nation. Gain frames were more effective when coupled with a promotion focus, and loss frames had a more impact when combined with a prevention focus. A moderated mediation analysis demonstrated support, attitudes, and perceived vulnerability mediated an interaction effect between gain/loss frames and regulatory focus, on the intention to participate in Smart Nation initiatives.",

    "abstract": "This study examines whether the impact of offline identities on computer-mediated communication is stable across different social contexts or whether it depends on which identity aspect is salient. Field experiments with 206 teenagers tested the influence of gendered, ethnic, youth and personalized identities on teenagers' chat behaviour and cognitions. The findings show that offline identity varies in its relation to Internet self-efficacy but not chat partner selection. Self-efficacy differed significantly between boys and girls when youth and gender identities were emphasized but not when stressing personal identity. Across conditions, teenagers were most likely to choose chat partners from similar ethnic and opposite sex backgrounds. This partly supports the Social Identification and Deindividuation framework and argues that offline identities impact online behaviour and self-perception but that this effect depends on which identity aspect is activated.",

    "title": "Reverting trajectories? UKIP’s organisational and discursive change after the Brexit referendum",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The article focuses on the transformation of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) after the 2016 Brexit referendum. It describes how, after securing its chief political demand, UKIP opened up to grassroots far-right politics and assesses whether this strategy involved a concomitant shift towards a more radical discourse. Against a backdrop of organisational change, the findings refine the notion that a far-right turn within its ranks led to a significant shift in the (online) communication of the party towards issues like immigration, Islam, and gender. Indeed, these issues were mostly ‘outsourced’ to the cultural wing of the party, War Plan Purple. The article therefore critically links changes in UKIP’s organisation with shifts in online communication, adding new insights into the unorthodox politics and forms of mobilisation of the far right.",

    "title": "‘We need to get together and make ourselves heard’: everyday online spaces as incubators of political action",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article examines to what extent, and how, people engaging in political talk within ‘non-political’ discussion forums – online lifestyle communities – leads to political (or personal) action or calls-to-action. The analysis is framed in the context of wider questions of citizenship, civic engagement and political mobilization. To capture everyday political talk amongst citizens requires us to move beyond the now widely analysed online spaces of formal politics. Instead, we focus on online third spaces concerning lifestyle issues such as parenting, personal finance and popular culture. Drawing on a content analysis of three popular UK-based discussion forums over the course of five years (2010–2014), we found that (for two of the three cases) such spaces were more than just talking shops. Rather they were spaces where political actions not only emerged, but where they seemed to be cultivated. Discussions embedded in the personal lives of participants often developed – through talk – into political actions aimed at government (or other) authorities. The article sheds light on the contributing factors and processes that (potentially) trigger and foster action emerging from political talk and provides insight into the mobilization potential of third spaces.",

    "abstract": "Communication technologies have historically isolated D/deaf and hard of hearing people from information in mainstream society, for example, the telephone, radio, and television are all inaccessible to D/deaf without relay services or subtitles. This paper therefore begins by examining the consequences for D/deaf people's personal information landscapes of their exclusion from traditional off-line Information sources. It then goes onto examine how D/deaf people are using the Internet to access general and Deaf information sources, and how these practices are affecting their information capacities, and social relations. The paper concludes by reflecting on some of the constraints on Deaf people's abilities to make full and effective use of this information and communication resource and the complex, and sometimes paradoxical roles, the Internet plays in relation to D/deaf people's integration in hearing society. It important to know more about how the Internet is currently benefiting/failing to meet the needs of this group in order to further develop appropriate information resources and services for D/deaf people.",

    "title": "CHILDREN IN CREATIONIST CAPITALISM",
    "abstract": "The term ‘creationist capitalism’ attempts to capture a shift or a trend in capitalism that is currently being described as a move away from consumption to that of prosumption. At the heart of prosumption is the intertwining of economic profit-making with individual creativity. This study explores how creationist capitalism is produced and pushed forward in corporate practices and understandings. Particular attention is paid to virtual worlds that rely on user-generated content. The case study of Habbo Hotel examines company practices that shape children's experiences online and opens for scrutiny some of the complex political and ethical issues that these practices pose. The aim is to demonstrate that children's interactions, particularly online, should be explored within a framework that identifies the intimate links between social aspirations and economic production. In virtual worlds, children's social aims and desires interweave with capitalist profit-making in imaginative and sometimes unexpected ways.",
